00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,320
For the last five weeks, we've pitched our Bake Off tent in sunny, beautiful Essex, 

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,680
where we've reduced our stock of hardworking, hand-picked bakers from 12 to just seven. 

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,080
We've feasted on cakes, quiches, breads, tarts, and biscuits, 

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,840
and I, for one, have room for more. 

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,920
The remaining bakers have got two days of gruelling challenges 

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,120
to find out if they've got what it takes to stay in the competition. 

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,320
So welcome to the Great British Bake Off. 

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,600
Last week, the bakers tackled biscuits 

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,280
and Jason's flawless macaroons... 

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,840
- They taste so good! 
- ..saw him crowned Star Baker. 

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
Along with Holly, who impressed the judges in all three challenges. 

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
Delicious! 

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,760
But someone had to go and three bad bakes... 

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,840
- It is a disaster. 
- They're horrendous. 

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,920
..led to Ben leaving the Great British Bake Off. 

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,560
I'm just disappointed. 

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,760
This week the bakers confront pies, which drives some to despair... 

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,600
A big disaster. 

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
- What a mess.
- ..but brings out perfection in others. 

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,920
I can't fault it. 

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,960
Pies might be considered my weakness, so I can see the hazards ahead. 

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,160
I was pleased with mine until I saw yours. 

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,400
Bam. 

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,800
The seven remaining bakers now face three daunting challenges 

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
over the next two days - 

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,440
all based around the humble pie. 

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,760
But whoever falls short will miss out on their chance 

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,240
to compete in next week's quarter-final. 

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Bakers, welcome back to another glorious sunny day, 

30
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,240
and today we enter the world of pie. 

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,400
And today, it's signature bake. 

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,720
So, for this, you'll be required to produce a hearty family pie 

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,840
with either a rough-puff or a flaky pastry topping. 

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,400
OK, you've got eagle eyes and silver fox all over this one, 

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,080
so, on your marks, get set, bake. 

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,560
This complex challenge demands the bakers combine making both the pastry 

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,040
and the filling, and then baking them together. 

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Timing and flavouring are crucial 

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,920
and they have just two and a half hours to perfect their signature pie. 

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Main problems they'll face with the pie is not getting the pastry quite right. 

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,960
It should have risen beautifully, be finished off well, a nice crust. 

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,400
And once we cut into the pie, the proportion of the filling 

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
and sauce should complement each other and, of course, 

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,880
it should be well seasoned. 

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,200
Both rough-puff and flaky are the best pastries to use when making pies, 

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,400
as the light crispy texture contrasts with the dense meat, fish or vegetable fillings. 

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm making flaky pastry at the moment. 

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,440
It doesn't rise as much as puff pastry 

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,240
but it's really nice on pies, so I'm just hoping that they like it. 

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Flaky pastry is made by blending flour, 

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
salt and butter to make dough 

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,160
to which small pieces of butter are then added 

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,480
before the rolling, folding and resting. 

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,240
- One, two, three...
- You're busy.
- Morning, Yasmin. 

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,240
You're counting peppercorns. This is precision stuff. 

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,000
I need to get them all out. I don't want anyone biting on a peppercorn. 

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,760
- True.
- What are you making for us, then?
- I'm making a fish pie. 

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Yasmin is hoping for success with her family fish pie. 

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,160
And for an added touch of luxury, she's adding quail's eggs. 

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,400
- Now, the pastry. You're doing... 
- Flaky pastry. 

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,120
- You're doing it the way my mum makes it.
- Oh, really?
- By grating. 

62
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Exactly, that's how my mother did it. 

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I put it in the freezer this morning so it was nice and hard, 

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,400
and she used to buy special butter that was just for grating, I seem to remember. 

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,280
To be honest with you, I'm a puff pastry man myself... 

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
- Not a euphemism.
- I enjoy making puff pastry, so I'm fascinated. 

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
I opted out of puff pastry as I was scared of it not rising. 

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
But he is a professional. 

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,920
We're all amateurs, which is the difference. 

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,360
We choose a pastry that's easy to handle and gets good results. 

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
I wouldn't say that flaky was easy, though. 

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,480
- Right, Holly, it's a hive of industry here.
- Yes, it is. 

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,640
Tell us about your pie. 

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a three cheese, caramelised onion and potato pie with a flaky pastry lid. 

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Very nice. 

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,240
Holly's the only one making a vegetarian pie. 

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Stilton, potato and caramelised onions are flavoured 

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
with extra Gruyere and strong Cheddar. 

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,360
My husband is one of those men, if there's not meat in a meal, 

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,680
he hunts for it, so whenever a vegetarian family come over 

81
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm not going to make two meals. I have make something that's tasty enough for him to say, 

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,640
"It's OK that there's no meat." So... 

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
So you have to fool him? 

84
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
My cooking's just family cooking, you know? 

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm not pretending it's terribly refined or anything. 

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,040
And that's the way it is. 

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,960
Janet is making a chicken and bacon pie with chestnuts, 

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,160
baked in a butter and milk roux. 

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Usually I make this at Christmas with the remains of the turkey, 

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,880
but I couldn't bring myself to ask for turkey in May. 

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,280
It seemed just completely wrong. 

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,320
So...I'm doing a chicken version. 

93
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,520
So, it sort of keeps the theme of Christmas 

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,280
but in a different form. 

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Did you get that? 

96
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Mary-Anne's taking a novel approach to keeping her dough cool 

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
and her flakes perfect. 

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,000
What I'm going to do is to put everything into a freezer bag 

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,400
and then use a rolling pin on the outside 

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
to flatten the hard butter and lard into flakes, 

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,600
so, rather than do it by consecutive rolling, 

102
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm going to make the flakes and then mix, add the liquid. 

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,040
Just two tablespoons of water and one of vinegar 

104
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,240
to bring it together into a pastry. 

105
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Since the competition began, 

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,840
Mary-Anne's experimental approach has resulted in some unusual recipes. 

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,120
And her signature dish of chicken and bacon with flaky pastry 

108
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,240
is no exception. 

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,080
The pastry I'm doing is flaky pastry, 

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,600
but it's not really the traditional method of making it. 

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,960
I've chopped up the butter and the fat, 

112
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,160
and I've put them in the freezer to harden them up, 

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,360
and then I've got a mixture of flour, salt, 

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,160
and a little bit of cream cheese. 

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Mary-Anne has also added vinegar to her pastry, 

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
which, when combined with fat, inhibits strands of gluten forming - 

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
in theory, keeping it flaky. 

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Mary-Anne, she was battering something in a plastic bag. 

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,080
It's rather a mucked-about recipe. We'll see the result, but what a mess. 

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,080
You know, that bag, and in and out of it. And also, the things that are in it, I mean, 

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,600
baking powder and vinegar is quite unnecessary. We shall see. 

122
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
They look like they mean business today. 

123
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,600
Mary is dressed as a cowgirl. I think that means business. 

124
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,680
She's got her hand in the wrong pocket, though. Should be at the front. 

125
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,680
While four of the bakers have chosen to make flaky pastry, 

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,240
the remaining bakers, Rob, Jo, and Jason, are all making rough-puff. 

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,280
At the moment, I'm just grating frozen butter. 

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,120
That'll be mixed into the flour, creating a buttery streak 

129
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,040
so when it cooks, those will puff up to make it puff. 

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Rough-puff is harder to make as it requires definition in its layers 

131
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,240
in place of the irregularity of flaky pastry, where imperfections are part of the effect. 

132
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,760
- Hello, Rob.
- Hi.
- So, you're at the pastry making stage.
- Yes. 

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,680
- It's quite wet at this stage. 
- It is wet at this stage. 

134
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,640
Has there been a misunderstanding with the ingredients? 

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,240
No, because I never actually measure the water, I just put it in. 

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,600
- That is too wet, though.
- Yes.
- But you can just add a bit more fat. 

137
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
In his head, I can just hear, "Overworked, overworked, overworked." 

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Lancashire-born Rob sees pie making as one of his specialities, 

139
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,440
and has chosen to make a traditional chicken and mushroom pie 

140
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
with clove studded onion. 

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,760
But, in previous weeks, timing has not been Rob's strong point. 

142
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,920
I have no idea how long it usually takes me 

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
cos usually, I'm doing it while other people are around 

144
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,760
having a drink, so I have no idea. 

145
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,160
I think we've got plenty of time, so I'm not worried about this at all. 

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,840
Once the butter's been combined, the rough-puff dough must be rolled, 

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,680
folded, turned and rested three times 

148
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,720
and must be kept cool so that the butter doesn't melt before baking. 

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,360
- Have you tested this out on the family?
- Yes. 

150
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,480
The kids aren't lovers of pastry, but they all tried the middle. 

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,880
Dylan loves salmon, and Billy really liked it. Yeah, they did. 

152
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,920
- They gave you the thumbs up?
- Yep. 

153
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,040
Jo's salmon and asparagus pie is flavoured with a delicate white wine shallot and cream sauce. 

154
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,000
Mary and Paul are not expecting the pies to have a pastry base. 

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
However, they do want to see the crust and filling baked together. 

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,440
- Hello, Jo.
- 'And Jo's made a controversial decision.' 

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm actually doing a deconstructed pie. 

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm doing my pie topped separately 

159
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,560
on a baking sheet in the oven and I'm going to put it on afterwards 

160
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
because with the salmon, it only needs such a light cooking 

161
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,280
and I was a bit concerned about getting all the seasoning 

162
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,200
and everything right when it was in the oven, 

163
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,280
and I didn't want to overcook it, so I decided to cook my pie top separately. 

164
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,920
I think it's rather sad 

165
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
not to make pastry flavoured by the fish. We'll see. 

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm going to stick with my pastry lid separately 

167
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,480
because I practised this at home, and maybe if I'd known Mary wasn't that keen before today, 

168
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,760
I would have practised it otherwise, but I have to stick with it, 

169
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
otherwise it could just all go really wrong. 

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
- What pastry are you using today, Jason?
- I'm making rough-puff pastry. 

171
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,080
- Can I have a look at your pastry? 
- I've grated the butter in. 
- You've just mixed it? 

172
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,120
- Yeah.
- So you've grated the butter in. OK. 

173
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,640
Jason's filling of a spicy Caribbean brown down chicken 

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,720
may have traditional routes, but it's never been seen in a pie until now. 

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,760
- Brown down, can you explain?
- Yeah. The brown down is how it's cooked, 

176
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,640
so before you cook any of the filling, you heat oil in a pan 

177
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,880
with a bit of sugar so it caramelises and adds a nice sweetness. 

178
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,760
- I've got quite a few spices. 
- Is it like a Cajun style? Or Bajun style?
- Yeah, yeah. 

179
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,440
As their pastry chills, 

180
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,680
most bakers have began to tackle what's inside their signature pies. 

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,600
Bold flavours are essential. 

182
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,480
But the judges will also be looking for combinations that complement the rich, buttery pastry. 

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,120
Ladies and gents, 

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
time flies when you're baking pies. 

185
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,080
You've got one hour left on the clock. 

186
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,640
Oh, look. OK, using the spoon. 

187
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,840
- I don't like this term.
- What is it? 

188
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,000
Knocking up the edges. 

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,080
It makes it sound like you've done something horrible to the pie. 

190
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,200
- Did that go according to plan?
- Yes. 

191
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Sealing is critical. 

192
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,920
If the filling bursts through the pastry, the pie's appearance will be ruined. 

193
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,120
Egg wash ensures a golden crust when baked. 

194
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,960
- Have you egg washed that enough? 
- I hope so.
- OK.
- I can't go on dipping and dabbing. 

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,920
No, you're absolutely right. Get it in there. 

196
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,880
I don't know why I'm watching it. 

197
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,080
It's not going to make it any better, is it? 

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,720
That's 10 minutes on the pie clock. 

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,160
Accurate oven time for pies is critical. 

200
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,840
While the filling must be perfectly cooked, the pastry must be well risen 

201
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,720
and only just golden brown. 

202
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,280
- I thought you had yours out?
- I did, and then I shoved it back in again. 

203
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,640
- Just to be on the safe side?
- Yes. 

204
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,760
That's just two minutes on the pies. 

205
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,200
It's a really good fit, thankfully. 

206
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,040
SHE BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF 

207
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
OK, the time for pie is nigh. 

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,440
So bring your pies to the end of your benches 

209
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
and prepare for judging. 

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,000
It's judgement time for the signature bake. 

211
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,040
- Hello, Rob.
- You all right? 

212
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,280
Visually, it's got a nice colour. 

213
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,040
Overall, it's a nice bake, but the pastry's shrunk 

214
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,560
so that means it needed a bit more resting. If it isn't rested and chilled, 

215
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
that's what happens. It slips in. 

216
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
Your chicken is slightly overcooked. 

217
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,840
You've chosen to cook your pastry separately. 

218
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, I didn't want to overcook my salmon. 

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,520
I don't know whether you've convinced me. 

220
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,000
The sauce has split. The flavour of the salmon's good. 

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
It's seasoned well. 

222
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,160
My only cause for concern is how thick that is. There hasn't been much of a build up of layers. 

223
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,760
- It doesn't look part of the pie. 
- No, it does look a separate thing. 

224
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,400
- You've got a nice colour to the top. 
- A little underdone under the pastry. 

225
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
Now, doesn't that look good inside? 

226
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,320
- You've got some lovely colour in there.
- Your pastry's too thin. 

227
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,840
There's not much rise in there. It's rubbery. 

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,560
It's a lovely flavour. You've got the seasoning right, which is good. 

229
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,080
That really does look a lovely, family pie. 

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,240
It's got a wonderful shine on the top. It's well-risen. 

231
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,040
- There's so much filling in there. 
- That smells really nice. 

232
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,760
I like the colours. 

233
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,000
Got some nice layers going on. 

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
That taste is lovely. 

235
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,120
You've nailed that taste. 

236
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,800
I can't fault it, really. 

237
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,000
- You've no idea how much that's made my day.
- She's gone red. 

238
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,400
This needs more bake to get the colour. 

239
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,840
This is very, very light. It's anaemic. 

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,280
The chicken is overcooked. 

241
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,840
The vegetables are very interesting, the spices are fun. 

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,360
- It's really quite different.
- The pastry hasn't got much of a rise. 

243
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,800
You need to build up more layers in there, because it's quite thin. 

244
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
The flavour of that, though, is fantastic. 

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
- That's a nice finish on the top, there, Mary-Anne.
- It looks great. 

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,600
I like the decoration you put on it. The colour's good. 

247
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,960
Now, that's a good consistency. 

248
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,200
It seems to me a very different, complicated pastry. 

249
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,360
- You've got too much vinegar in there, you know.
- Yeah? 

250
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,200
I can taste it. It's not nice. 

251
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,080
The interior is beautiful, well cooked, perfect. 

252
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,040
- But that is a... It's a shame.
- OK. 

253
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,400
You haven't got much of a flake. You've got a little bit, see there? 

254
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,080
Yes, yes. I think I could have done it thicker, to be honest. 

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,360
It needed to be thicker and maybe more folds which would have created more of a laminate. 

256
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,600
- It's very crispy.
- The chicken is cooked perfectly.
- Good. 

257
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,880
The leeks come through. 

258
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
The seasoning is right and there's pepper there. For me, it's right. 

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
I think that's good. 

260
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,640
Holly is the only baker to escape the judging unscathed. 

261
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm a little bit in shock. I feel a bit sick, actually. 

262
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,200
I'm really pleased. Really pleased. 

263
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,800
The others will have to up their game to secure their future in the bake off. 

264
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,640
The pastry was underdone. I was trying to not overdo the chicken but the chicken was overdone as well. 

265
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,520
I would like to have done better, but what's done is done. 

266
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,960
It wasn't all negative, so I'm pleased about that. 

267
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,760
I feel quite annoyed with myself, really, 

268
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,280
that having made plenty of pastry, 

269
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,200
I could have made it quite a lot thicker. 

270
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
The end result would, no doubt, have been better. 

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,560
But, you know, we have to just move onto the next thing 

272
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,120
and hope to do slightly better. 

273
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,040
We ate Â£150m worth of pork pies in the UK last year. I say "we"... 

274
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,160
But a staggering one third of those were made in a small Leicestershire town. 

275
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,400
Melton Mowbray. 

276
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,560
The story of pork pies begins in the early 18th century. 

277
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,760
In about the 1720s, there were lots of smallholdings 

278
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,920
and farms making cheese, and the by-product is whey. 

279
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,840
Whey's very rich in protein, and, of course, it's free. 

280
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
The smallholders fed it to their pigs. The area became famous for pork. 

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
In the summer, the smallholders would fatten the pigs 

282
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,080
and in the winter, when there was less feed, they were slaughtered. 

283
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,960
Portions of the meats, the shoulder and the belly, were turned into pork pies, 

284
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
which is a way of preserving the meat. 

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,640
Original pork pies were pretty crude, 

286
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,720
and were given to the farm labourers who would take them to the field. 

287
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,080
At lunchtime, they would break them open and eat the meat inside. 

288
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,800
You'd throw away the pastry because the pastry was black, hard, inedible. 

289
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,040
Pork pies were being made across the UK. 

290
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,040
But in the 1830s, Melton Mowbray's took on star status. 

291
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
At this time, the region was famous for hunting. 

292
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,800
And every winter, the country's most influential lords and ladies 

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,520
- flocked there for their sport, and to sample the local food. 
- During the hunting season, 

294
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,160
the labourers would work as grooms looking after the horses. 

295
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,600
The aristocracy took a glimpse at these pies and wanted to try them. 

296
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,720
They liked the meat, but didn't like this awful pastry coating and wanted a posher version. 

297
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
At the time, hot water pastry was being developed. 

298
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,200
A mix of boiling pork fat and flour which gave crumbly texture and rich flavour. Perfect for pork pies. 

299
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,280
The aristocracy loved this. It was a robust meal that they would pack in their saddlebags 

300
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,760
and eat literally on the hoof. When the hunt season was over in the spring, the aristocracy 

301
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,400
would return to London and tell all their friends about these amazing pies. 

302
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,640
Everybody wanted a slice of them. 

303
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,680
The bakers in Melton Mowbray would make them out of season, and they would send them 

304
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,240
to London on the Royal Mail Stagecoach, one of the first examples of food by mail order. 

305
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Almost 300 years later, the Melton Mowbray unique pie 

306
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
was awarded protected geographical status, 

307
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,640
giving the humble pork pie the same kudos as Champagne and Parma ham. 

308
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,680
To use the Melton Mowbray name today, 

309
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,360
there are some strict rules you must stick to. 

310
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Number one is the pork. It must be fresh, British and uncured. 

311
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Number two, they're baked with no support, 

312
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,800
so there's no tin or hoop to hold them up. 

313
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,960
They will naturally sag and you end up with this classic bow-sided, pot-bellied shape. 

314
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,800
And number three is that they must be baked 

315
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,320
within this designated geographical area around Melton Mowbray. 

316
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,880
This is our heartland, and if anyone's going to be passionate and protective of them, 

317
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,120
then it's going to be the local community. 

318
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,520
To make a Melton Mowbray pork pie takes four days. 

319
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,320
Day one, you make the pastry, day two, you make the pie, 

320
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,600
day three, you bake it and day four, it's ready to sell and eat, 

321
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,760
and that can't be rushed, it's almost reverent, 

322
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,680
and that's why we're so passionate about it. 

323
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Bakers, no time to rest on the rough-puff laurels. 

324
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,840
Now comes the dreaded technical challenge. 

325
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,720
As always with the technical challenge, Mary and Paul, it's judged blind, 

326
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,360
- so we're going to ask you to leave the tent.
- Goodbye. 

327
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
OK, bakers, for the technical challenge, 

328
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,040
we're going to ask you to make a batch of six miniature pork pies. 

329
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,560
Now, cos the fillings need time to set, 

330
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,600
you're making it today and it'll be resting overnight, 

331
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,240
so the judging will actually take place tomorrow. 

332
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,880
- You've got two and a half hours. We wish you all the very best of luck. On your marks, get set...
- Bake. 

333
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Each baker has been given exactly the same recipe and ingredients, 

334
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,640
and must produce six perfect miniature pork pies. 

335
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,760
As always in the technical bake, the detail of the recipe is missing, 

336
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,240
and it's up to the bakers to fill in the gaps using their skill and knowledge. 

337
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,120
Paul has set the bakers his own recipe, where the centre contains a difficult-to-achieve surprise. 

338
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,200
I try and go straight down the middle so I can get that egg... 

339
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,400
- There you go. And you can see... 
- That looks beautiful. 

340
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,440
You've got the gelatine all around, squared off at the bottom, 

341
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,400
- jelly's all the way down to the bottom. You can see it's set. 
- And right to the top. 

342
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,960
And up to the top. And nicely filled with small pieces of meat. 

343
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,760
And again, perfectly in the middle is the quail's egg. 

344
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,920
It looks absolutely beautiful. 

345
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,880
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers. 

346
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,000
Pork pies use hot water crust, 

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,800
an infamously complicated pastry variation that few bakers, 

348
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,240
including professionals, are brave enough to use. 

349
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
I feel a bit out of my depth. 

350
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,400
Never made hot crust, whatever it is, before. 

351
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Hot water crust pastry is made by heating lard and butter in a pan with water, 

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
being careful not to let the mixture boil 

353
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,720
before adding it to flour and salt and mixing into a smooth, shiny dough. 

354
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,640
What does it say? Stirring till it comes together... 

355
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
Work into a ball. 

356
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Looks like a ball already. 

357
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm not going to risk using it all. 

358
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,720
That could be my downfall. 

359
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,160
The shiny dough must be cool enough to work, but must be moulded while still warm. 

360
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,000
It's quite odd working with something that's quite so warm, 

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,880
since normally with pastry, it's supposed to be cold, cold, cold. 

362
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
The pastry has to be rolled thin, 

363
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,760
but if it cools too much, it becomes flaky, dry and impossible to mould. 

364
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,120
I don't get how this pastry works at all. 

365
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,280
It's rock hard, it's quite odd stuff. 

366
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,560
I used all my strong flour instead of quarter and a half. 

367
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,520
Talk about cack-handed! But I can't swap, because I've got floury hands! 

368
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm worried about time now. I'm going to have to work really fast. 

369
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,280
This is pastry 2.0, cos the first one I thought was too wet. 

370
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm running the risk because... Whoops. 

371
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,840
The filling is every bit as difficult. 

372
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,400
Pork loin, onion, bacon and parsley must be finely chopped so that it can be tightly packed, 

373
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,040
otherwise the egg simply won't be held in the correct position. 

374
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,080
I'm so going to cut my fingers today. I'm actually shaking now. 

375
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,520
Just being judged on anything is quite nerve-wracking. 

376
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,200
Although she's never used hot water crust before, 

377
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,440
Yasmin regularly makes pork pies for her children to take to school with them. 

378
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,480
I've never seen pork so minced as that. That is a well and truly minced pork, by hand. 

379
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,960
I actually chewed it! 

380
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,400
Yes, regurgitate your pork, finely. 

381
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I just don't want them saying...cos everything says "finely chopped." 

382
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,960
- They mean that.
- I don't want to lose out on... "It's nice, but lumpy." 

383
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,440
Taking the filling out. 

384
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,680
I didn't season it at all, 

385
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,320
so definitely not going to get away with that. Unseasoned pork... 

386
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
OK, let's try this again. 

387
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
I've never made pork pies. 

388
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,080
I've never even boiled a quail's egg before! 

389
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,120
I'm not very grand. 

390
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm not eating like Henry VIII, quail's eggs and lark's tongues. 

391
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,800
Working with quail's eggs is a first for many of the bakers. 

392
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,760
They need to be boiled only just long enough 

393
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
so they're firm and easy to peel. 

394
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,760
Are you ready? Jump up if you are. 

395
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,600
But boil them too long, and once in the pie and in the oven, they'll overcook and go hard. 

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
How long do you boil a quail's egg for, do you know? 

397
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,000
No-one seems to know. I don't know. 

398
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,160
All I know is under two and a half minutes, cos this is overdone! 

399
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,520
- Is it?
- Yeah. 

400
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,560
I've never boiled an egg before. 

401
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,800
- What, just a normal egg or just a quail's egg?
- Normal egg. 

402
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,120
- You've never boiled a normal egg before?
- I don't eat boiled egg. 

403
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,480
You can make a macaroon but you can't boil an egg? 

404
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,120
No. 

405
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,880
Once the egg is packed within the filling, the lids are placed on the pies 

406
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,200
with a small hole in each to allow steam to escape 

407
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,880
and for the jelly to be poured in after baking. 

408
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,120
Then they're well-sealed and crimped to stop the filling seeping out. 

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
The pies are egg-washed and put in the oven to bake for 40 minutes. 

410
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,360
Bakers, you have got ten minutes of pie fun to go. 

411
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,480
Ooh. 

412
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,840
Very interesting looking. 

413
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm going to leave them in there. 

414
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,600
They don't look cooked to me. 

415
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,360
When the pies are baked, the bakers make the jelly, 

416
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,920
which is done by dissolving a leaf of gelatine in hot water 

417
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,960
and adding chicken stock for flavour. 

418
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,200
Gelatine, where's that? Have I thrown it away? 

419
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,880
The warm liquid jelly is then poured in through the steam hole 

420
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,600
and will be left overnight to set. 

421
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,000
The jelly holds the meat and egg in place. 

422
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,200
I have a cunning plan. 

423
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,160
OK, that's it, time's up, 

424
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,040
and remember these aren't going to be judged until tomorrow, 

425
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,120
so you can stand easy, they'll sit in the fridge overnight, 

426
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,600
and then, judgment day. 

427
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,920
That was hard. I didn't know how much to work that pastry, 

428
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,120
I didn't know how the mixture reacted. 

429
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,440
It was the unknown that was quite hard. 

430
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,600
I think I did a good job of messing it up. 

431
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,920
Mine do not look very pork-pie-like. 

432
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,640
They exploded a bit and the gelatine was a weird colour. 

433
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,240
It's not my finest work, I have to say. 

434
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,560
It's not much fun waiting for the judges' overnight verdict. 

435
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,600
You over-think. I'll be sitting going, maybe they're too light, I should have cooked them for longer. 

436
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,640
It's not good, waiting, at all, it's just more suffering. 

437
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,880
The jellies have set, the pies have rested, 

438
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,560
and the moment of truth has arrived. 

439
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,800
Judging blind, Mary and Paul haven't seen the baking process, 

440
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,200
and have no idea which pies belongs to which baker. 

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,680
The colour's good, the egg is situated bang in the middle. 

442
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,360
- The meat's been cooked well. But the pastry's too thick.
- Much too thick. 

443
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,720
There's not much jelly in there at all. Hardly any, is there? 

444
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,360
- Nice flavour. 
- It's got a nice flavour. 

445
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,360
This has got hardly any gelatine in there as well. 

446
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,360
- And this one is slightly under-baked with the pastry.
- Yeah. Yeah. 

447
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
Good taste. 

448
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
I like the look of this one. There's been some form of display. 

449
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,760
They tried to create a pattern on the outside, which looks nice, and it's got a good colour on it. 

450
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,000
- It's a good bake. 
- Pastry is a bit thick, isn't it?
- Hm. 

451
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,680
The meat is nicely chopped up in here, small. 

452
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Nice flavour. The bake on this needs a bit more of a colour. 

453
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
There's no attempt of crimping round the outside. 

454
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
The egg's in the middle, the pastry's thinner. 

455
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But it's on the thick side. 

456
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,200
But the pieces on the lid, especially, very thick. 

457
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,040
It's not chopped very small, is it, the meat? 

458
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,560
- It's a little bland.
- Hm. 

459
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,680
I must say, I like that appearance. 

460
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,720
It looks home-made and inviting, and it's lovely thin pastry. 

461
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,040
Good flavour. 

462
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,280
- I like that.
- So do I. 

463
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,520
The pastry on this, it needed more of a bake, 

464
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,080
it's very, very soft. 

465
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,160
There's not enough meat in there, so it hasn't filled the lid, hasn't touched the top. 

466
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,360
- The meat is nice and small. 
- And so is the pastry thin. 

467
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,880
Little bit bland for me. Little bit more seasoning. 

468
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,840
The appearance is a bit irregular. 

469
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,800
And again, it's to do with the meat spewing out the top. 

470
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,000
It's a lovely thin crust. 

471
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,400
That's one of the things that's so difficult to get right. 

472
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,160
I'm sure you've found. It's very tasty. 

473
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,280
Paul and Mary must now rank the bakes from the worst to the best. 

474
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,200
OK, we've made our decisions, 

475
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,840
and the person in last place, Mary. 

476
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
This one here. 

477
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,480
The pastry is far too thick. There's not enough filling there and the pieces are far too big. 

478
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,280
It needed longer baking as well. 

479
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,960
And in sixth place is this one. 

480
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,440
- That's me.
- Jo. 

481
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,040
It was uncooked in places. I didn't see much gelatine in there as well. 

482
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
It was quite dry. 

483
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,040
And this one. The pastry has come away from the filling 

484
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,160
and there's no sign of any jelly in there, 

485
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,720
and the bake wasn't so good either. 

486
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,240
With Holly fourth and Rob third, the battle for top place in the technical challenge 

487
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
is between Janet and Mary-Anne. 

488
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,600
So, down to the last two. Second place is this one. 

489
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,160
They're pretty good, Mary-Anne. I like the way you've done it. 

490
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,080
The pastry's a little bit thick at the bottom, but good pie. 

491
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,440
And if you're very clever, you've worked out who's number one. 

492
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,840
Pastry was just the right thickness. 

493
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
We've got a little bit of gelatine in there too, 

494
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,520
- and the meat was beautifully flavoured and well cut up. Well done.
- I'm very grateful! 

495
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Well done! 

496
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,240
To be honest, I'm absolutely amazed because I've never made a pork pie 

497
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,920
and never intended to. 

498
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,440
So this doing well today is like a little gold star, so that's nice. 

499
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,560
So I'm happy. Yes, I'm happy. 

500
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,200
Fifth out of seven isn't the best ranking. 

501
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,800
It's not a safe place to be. 

502
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,840
I know it's not the bottom, but when there are so few people left now, 

503
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,080
nowhere's particularly safe to be unless you've just come out first. 

504
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,800
I was pretty much expecting to be number seven 

505
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,960
from the comments they gave, so it's quite a sad feeling. 

506
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,040
It's not good to feel I'm doing so bad. 

507
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,440
I feel like I'm letting the judges down, cos I've done well in the past. 

508
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,000
I want to win the competition. I don't know if I've got what it takes. 

509
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,320
Sometimes I believe I have, sometimes I don't. 

510
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
It's the final challenge. 

511
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,680
There's one last opportunity for the bakers to secure their future in the competition. 

512
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,160
I think Jason's in serious trouble. 

513
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,560
If his showstopper is in the bottom half, he's in serious trouble. 

514
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,960
- Jo's pie.
- This was the separate lid. 
- The lid didn't work. 

515
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,120
I haven't forgiven her for that. It's not a pie. 

516
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,160
- You've got to bring in Yasmin, as well.
- Really?
- Yeah. 

517
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,640
- The fish pie yesterday?
- Yeah. 
- The crust, you said, wasn't... 
- It wasn't a great lamination. 

518
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
The layers weren't there. 

519
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,760
- Today, she came third from bottom. 
- So this is going to be a very interesting showstopper. 

520
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,320
We're going to be watching three people closely. 

521
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,360
It's very tight. It is very tight. 

522
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,200
Bakers, however stunning those pies were this morning, 

523
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,880
they were merely the warm-up act to the main event, 

524
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,680
the showstopper challenge. 

525
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,120
And for the first time we're asking you to bake a sweet pie. 

526
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,840
Mary and Paul are looking for your best meringue pie 

527
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,120
that you can possibly come up with. 

528
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,800
They're looking for people today who are going to take their baking to another level. 

529
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,920
Very best of luck. 

530
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,960
- On your marks, get set...
- Bake! 

531
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:21,880
Creating a perfect meringue pie requires accuracy and precision in three demanding baking disciplines. 

532
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,720
Their pastry base must be crisp. 

533
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,160
Their freshly made custard or fruit filling must be set. 

534
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,280
And their meringue topping has to be firm on the outside, but with a soft and chewy centre. 

535
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,240
The pies must be ready in just three and a half hours. 

536
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,360
This week's showstopper, it should be bold, magnificent, and it should taste superb. 

537
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,200
If they're going to use plums or peaches, or lemons or limes, 

538
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,600
the key thing is to get that flavour coming through into the filling. 

539
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,560
Probably made it about ten times, so practised, but maybe not enough. 

540
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,280
Holly aims to impress 

541
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,560
by perfecting a base of chocolate shortcrust pastry, 

542
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,320
filling it with fresh lime curd and topping it with an Italian meringue. 

543
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,480
Now tell us about this pastry. 

544
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,640
It's a nightmare to work with! 

545
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,040
- Why, Holly, why?
- It's all butter. 

546
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,160
It uses egg yolks to bind it. 

547
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,320
- Very difficult.
- What are you doing with that little wodge of pastry? 

548
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,360
This is because otherwise my fingernails go into it, 

549
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,680
- so I've been pushing.
- With the pastry?
- So I don't go through. 

550
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Do you know, Holly, that is a really good tip that everybody should take on board. 

551
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,960
I have chosen to make what I've called the Midnight Meringue. 

552
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,960
So it's a dark chocolate pastry and a dark meringue 

553
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,040
that's either going to be coffee or brown sugar. 

554
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,360
I read that brown sugar meringue tastes nice, 

555
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,520
and I've never made it so I thought, why not take the British Bake Off 

556
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,400
to have a go at making brown sugar meringue? 

557
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,560
Mary-Anne's unique pie will have a rich mocha filling 

558
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,720
and either a brown sugar or coffee meringue. 

559
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,840
She can't decide. 

560
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,720
I'm going to mix up both batches of meringue, taste them, see which I like the best, 

561
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,800
and then the winner gets to go on top. 

562
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,520
She's the one that's original. She's got an interesting crust, and she hasn't even rolled it out. 

563
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,400
She got it to the sort of crumb stage, and then worked it into the side, and that certainly works. 

564
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,040
- And she's good with the old flavours, Mary-Anne.
- Yes, she is. 

565
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,120
I'm under pressure because I have not performed well this week, such a crying shame. 

566
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,920
I guess pies aren't my thing, 

567
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,040
I think it's something I've just discovered. 

568
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
So... 

569
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,960
Jason's future in the bake off 

570
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,200
could rest on a pie with a fresh plum filling 

571
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,040
and pastry infused with ground ginger, cinnamon and orange zest. 

572
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,040
One of the things which you're particularly strong on 

573
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,840
is your combination of flavours, 

574
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,720
but you must get technically the bake right. That's the key thing. 

575
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,720
As the competition goes on, there's so many... 

576
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,720
The things they're picking up on are so tiny, you cannot put your guard down on anything, really. 

577
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,840
Rob has to stay focused to pull off his showstopper. 

578
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,120
It's filled with fresh rhubarb poached in sugar, star anise and vanilla. 

579
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:25,280
Now, it's all about timings on this one. You're notorious for pushing that right to the limit. 

580
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,320
Are you comfortable about getting it done in that time? 

581
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,960
Yeah. That's one of the things I've been working on the past few weeks, cos I know I was a bit rubbish. 

582
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,200
He's getting better. 

583
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,640
You have to speed up into the sense where you don't lose control. 

584
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,560
That's the secret. You've got to speed things up. 

585
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,000
To keep their pastry cases crisp, the bakers are blind baking, 

586
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,400
using baking beans to maintain the shape of their pastry. 

587
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,320
These days you might enjoy a lovely sweet meringue pie for dessert, 

588
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,600
but in the Middle Ages, they had medicinal purposes too, 

589
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,040
which led to some pretty weird pies. 

590
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,360
I've come to the British home of medieval folklore, Glastonbury, to find out more. 

591
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,600
What were the basic principles of medicine in medieval times? 

592
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Medicine was based on ancient Greek ideas, 

593
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,840
and these go back to Hippocrates and Galen. 

594
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,040
Their theories were based on something called the four humours. 

595
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,720
The four humours were bodily fluids. 

596
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,320
They were blood, bile, yellow bile and black bile, and phlegm. 

597
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,920
Balancing the four humours was essential 

598
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,280
in maintaining a person's health, and food played an important role. 

599
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,240
What you ate was said to be linked to each of the humours, 

600
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,480
and categorised as either hot, cold, wet or dry. 

601
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,520
It was believed that if you were sick, 

602
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,360
you could achieve good health by eating foods 

603
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,080
that opposed your symptoms and rebalanced your humours. 

604
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,240
If you've got an excess of a specific humour, you need to get that taken out of your body. 

605
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,880
If you don't have enough of a humour, you've got to have it put into your body. 

606
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,400
So say I've got a fever, 

607
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,240
what might have been good for me to eat in medieval times? 

608
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,280
Some fish. Fish is really good, cold and wet. 

609
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,120
- To counteract the hot and dry. 
- That's right. 

610
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,800
It sounds quite sensible, in a way. 

611
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,720
Well, every period of time has to have its own system of explaining health and illness, 

612
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,360
and this was just part of the medieval system of health beliefs and practices. 

613
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,680
In medieval kitchens across England, 

614
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,320
cooks attempted to create meals that perfectly balanced the humours. 

615
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,920
As health was prioritised over taste, 

616
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,840
this often led to the combination of all four elements in one single dish. 

617
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,080
The key thoughts behind the medieval desire for health was balance, 

618
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,280
so from the cook's point of view you're looking for things 

619
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
that are hot, dry, cold and wet. 

620
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,680
So you're aiming to create the perfectly balanced pie? 

621
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,280
I'm looking to create a balanced pie, yes, that's not going to cause ill health in anybody. 

622
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,280
To create the perfect pie, pigeons, which were considered light and airy 

623
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,160
and rabbits, which were earthy, were poached to provide the cold and dry elements. 

624
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,720
Dates were stoned and filled with sugar and ginger 

625
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,520
to give the hot and dry ingredient. 

626
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,280
So Caroline, you've got the basics of the pie there. 

627
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,400
What do we move on to next? 

628
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,120
We move on to the custard, which is going to be enriched with bone-marrow. 

629
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,600
Right, that's a worry. 

630
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,040
That's a slight worry to me, 

631
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,120
the idea of a bone marrow in a custard. 

632
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,960
When I think of custard, I think bright yellow and sweet. 

633
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,360
It's not going to be sweet. 

634
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,360
The custard itself is the only liquid in here, so it's wet. 

635
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,080
Bone-marrow, dry definitely. 

636
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,280
Dry, cold, cold and dry. 

637
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,920
Words fail me. 

638
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,120
All I know is, I'm going to be eating that. 

639
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,680
Now, I have to say, this is a pie that's supposed to be good for health in medieval times. 

640
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,040
It doesn't look massively healthy to my modern eyes. 

641
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,560
Well, they didn't know about fat, calories, minerals, vitamins. 

642
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,240
What they were interested in, was balance of the humours. 

643
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,440
I'm feeling in quite good health now. 

644
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,400
Whether I will be after eating the pie, we'll see. Here we go. 

645
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,840
So what do you think of the pie? 

646
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm getting savoury at the forefront and I'm getting sweet at the back. 

647
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,640
In a mad way, it does taste strangely medicinal. 

648
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,080
With their cases baking, 

649
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,800
the bakers must use this time to begin preparing their fillings. 

650
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,520
Oh, my lord. 

651
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,320
You have to be King Arthur to get the knife out of this. 

652
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,600
While she's performed well in the first two challengers, 

653
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,280
Janet is taking a risk with an unconventional rhubarb, orange and ginger filling. 

654
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:02,240
So this must be precision rhubarb pie coming out. Very unusual to me. 

655
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm going to do it in the oven, so it doesn't break down. 

656
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,840
I want to stand them up like terracotta warriors. 

657
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,560
- Just round the edge?
- The whole thing.
- The whole thing?
- Hopefully. 

658
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,480
It's going to take a bit of time to get them all there, but I hope it works. 

659
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,080
- I'm sure it will.
- I hope it works. 

660
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,880
- It's unique, I've never seen that before.
- Oh, really? Oh, OK. 

661
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,520
I've never ever made a meringue this size before. 

662
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,400
It will be a bit of a challenge. 

663
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,560
Jo's filling features fresh apple puree, whole raspberries and egg yolk, 

664
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,200
to create a luxurious fresh fruit custard. 

665
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,240
I want to make sure it's nice and smooth. 

666
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,080
I don't want to leave anything to chance today. 

667
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,680
I'm just taking my time 

668
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,960
and giving it much more attention than I ever have at home, to be absolutely honest. 

669
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,240
I want it to be perfect. 

670
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,080
My pie is going to be a peach and raspberry pie, with peach puree in the bottom 

671
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,960
and a raspberry ripple going through it. 

672
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,360
The combination between the sweet and slight bitterness coming from that raspberry, 

673
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,680
should be good. 

674
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,200
It's all about balancing those flavours 

675
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:20,240
and keeping that, for me, separate, because it will turn into a bit of a mush. 

676
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,360
This is a better padding. 

677
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,200
The bakers face a dilemma with meringue. 

678
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,320
They have a choice between preparing the classic French style, 

679
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,440
or the notoriously complicated Italian meringue. 

680
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,360
Both methods involve separating eggs and whipping the whites until they form soft peaks. 

681
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,480
Oh, no, why has that yolk gone in there? 

682
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,960
Even a speck of fat in the whites, such as a drop of egg yolk, 

683
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,120
will stop the proteins trapping air during the whipping process, 

684
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,400
resulting in a flat, watery meringue. 

685
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,720
A bit too much meringue in there, but it's OK. 

686
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,440
Just a little bit of egg yolk got in the egg white, 

687
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
but I think I've scooped it all out. I hope so. 

688
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,040
Those making French meringues must whip their whites to the soft peak stage 

689
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,280
before adding caster sugar and continuing to whip until the mixture forms stiff peaks. 

690
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,680
This is then piped or spooned on top of the filling before baking. 

691
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,560
I'm getting a bit of raspberry ripple in the meringue on the top. 

692
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,560
A nice bright colour to finish it off. 

693
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,800
Holly and Mary-Anne have risked preparing Italian meringue 

694
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,400
which uses boiling sugar syrup to cook the egg whites instead of baking. 

695
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,560
The syrup is made by melting sugar into water over heat. 

696
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,480
Once the syrup's reached 115 degrees centigrade, 

697
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,360
it must be poured into the egg whites and whipped until the mixture cools. 

698
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,280
Mary-Anne's made life twice as hard for herself. 

699
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,200
- Mary-Anne, I hear you're caught in the horn of a dilemma.
- I am. 

700
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I'm undecided with which meringue to put on. 

701
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,840
- What meringues have you got? 
- We've got brown sugar meringue here 

702
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,680
and here we've got the coffee meringue. 

703
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,600
- Do you trust my taste buds to give you an opinion?
- Er, yes. 

704
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
That's fun fair. 

705
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,520
That's lovely. Oh, that's Bonfire Night. 

706
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,080
I'll just stop this and you can try it. 

707
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,320
It's still got to cool down a bit, so mind yourself. 

708
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,040
- You don't make life easy for yourself, do you?
- No, no. 

709
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,600
The thing about you, Mary-Anne, is you're a thinker. 

710
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,640
- That's always going to hold you back in life.
- I know. 

711
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,640
As Mary-Anne deliberates, it's time for the five bakers making French meringues 

712
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,600
to pop them in the oven. 

713
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,600
OK, 15 minutes left, everyone, just 15 minutes. 

714
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,440
Oh, my gosh! 

715
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,680
Wow! I was really pleased with mine until I saw yours. 

716
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,960
Having opted for her brown sugar meringue, 

717
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,760
Mary-Anne's finishing with just minutes to spare. 

718
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,240
She's not the only one. 

719
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,040
I don't know if it's done. I can't tell. 

720
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
It's done at half an hour, leave it for an hour and a half and it goes more and more. 

721
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,600
This is like surgery now. 

722
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,480
Oh, no! My edge is falling off. 

723
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,920
No, that doesn't look good, does it? 

724
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,040
- Are you playing jigsaw? 
- I can't believe it. 
- The 'Janet' jigsaw puzzle. 

725
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,440
- There's this wobble I like. 
- Do you know what it is? 

726
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,320
I think it's sitting on the filling. 

727
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,840
It's like a turban, isn't it? A meringue turban. 

728
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,680
Despite being warned by Paul to watch his timing, Rob's pushed it right to the wire. 

729
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,320
Has it got to be out of the tin? 

730
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,000
Arghh! 

731
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,120
OK, the meringue challenge has reached a stiff peak. It's time to stop, time is up. 

732
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,640
Oh, yes. Bam! 

733
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:25,120
- The meringue looks great.
- Just... I can't do anything.
- No, soggy. 

734
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,920
For one of these bakers, this will be the last time they face the judges. 

735
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,280
Janet, would you like to bring your pie up? 

736
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,480
It looks fantastic, I'm telling you now. 

737
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
You've got a really nice colour round the edge, as well. 

738
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,360
There's a little patched up hole here. I bet you find it. 

739
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,560
You've got a decent bake underneath, which is quite surprising with the amount of liquid that's come out. 

740
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,520
I could feel it was baked underneath. 

741
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,960
Janet... 

742
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,840
- That is delicious. 
- The pastry is crisp and delicious. 

743
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,120
I'm flabbergasted, that you've managed to bake the base with that much fluid on it. 

744
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,760
That meringue is beautiful. Well done. 

745
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,440
Mary-Anne. 

746
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,960
It's dark, it's bold. 

747
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,600
To me, it looks jolly original. 

748
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,880
That's just what we want, to be able to get out the slice in one piece. 

749
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,040
I think that is scrumptious. So original, so different. 

750
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,400
Technically, that Italian meringue should've been firmer. 

751
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,920
It's too creamy. 

752
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,920
Haven't you put brown sugar in the top? In the Italian meringue? That's why it's not set. 

753
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,320
When you use brown sugar in a meringue, you're never going to get it. 

754
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,960
It's always a bit runny. 

755
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,720
Your base is cooked well. 

756
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,440
Yes, success with the base, lovely and short. 

757
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,120
The filling is very sharp, very good. 

758
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,400
I don't get too much chocolate because it's so thin on the base. 

759
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,920
I think it's wasted. 

760
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,240
For overall look, it looks attractive. 

761
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,160
It would've been as good to use a sweet paste, a normal, conventional sweet paste. 

762
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,480
It would've given it more stability. 

763
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,160
Jason. 

764
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,960
A bit of liquid coming out again. 

765
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:47,480
The pastry underneath is soggy and not quite cooked enough. 

766
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,640
The ratio of meringue to filling is rather too much. 

767
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,920
I tell you what, the plum sauce, I can't taste anything. This is bland. 

768
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,400
Plums essentially don't have that flavour to carry through. 

769
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,200
- It's nice and soft in the middle. 
- It's just like eating a meringue - I can't taste anything else. 

770
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,120
Rob. 

771
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,760
- It's happened again, hasn't it, Rob? 
- Yeah.
- Showstopper, a big disaster. 

772
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,520
Yeah, it's kind of fallen apart. 

773
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,240
It's just a little disappointing when we look into it. 

774
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,160
I think you've got a nice meringue. 

775
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,920
The rhubarb's not quite done enough as well. It's quite hard. 

776
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,680
It all tastes very good, but it hasn't worked as a whole. 

777
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,760
Yasmin. 

778
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,200
Visually, I love the top, I love what you've done to that. I think it looks great. 

779
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,640
The sides look underdone, for sure. You've got big areas on the side, 

780
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,640
so I wonder what it's going to be like underneath. 

781
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,320
- Nice to see the layers, isn't it? 
- It is quite wet down at the bottom. 

782
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,080
- Yeah.
- Actually, your structure is quite stable. 

783
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,200
The pastry is raw underneath. 

784
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,320
- Technically, the outside has let you down.
- Yeah. 

785
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,360
And that's the baking bit. 

786
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,200
Jo, last but not least. 

787
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,640
Now, the arrival of your meringue has coincided 

788
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,760
with the arrival of monsoon season. 

789
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,440
The pastry looks well cooked. 

790
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,040
However, there are lots of pieces missing. 

791
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,720
- Oh!
- I just wanted to have a quick look at the base. 

792
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,680
- It's actually baked underneath. 
- Well baked underneath. 

793
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,000
- It's nice and short as well, that, which is good. 
- It's lovely pastry, isn't it? 

794
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,800
The meringue melts, which is nice. 

795
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,720
It just looks a bit messy. But overall the actual tastes are very good. 

796
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,200
I don't think it was good. 

797
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,560
Obviously, Paul made a point of saying that my pastry wasn't cooked enough, and that's the baking part. 

798
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,360
I think I'm probably being considered for the chop this week. 

799
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,400
I was really disappointed in that result. 

800
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,320
I think there's only a certain amount of mess-ups that you can do before being kind of knocked off, 

801
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,360
so I kind of know that my head's on the chopping block. 

802
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,600
But the other chances went all right, so... 

803
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,640
To me, I just feel kind of anxious. 

804
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,760
Do I think I'm out, or is there a glimmer of hope that I might be in? 

805
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,000
I'd definitely say there's a glimmer of hope. 

806
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,920
Paul and Mary must now decide who should be this week's star baker 

807
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,320
and who won't be coming back for this year's quarter-final. 

808
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,160
Let's look at the positive end of the spectrum - star baker. Now, who are the contenders this week? 

809
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,640
- Certainly Janet and Mary-Anne. 
- She's had a very good weekend, hasn't she? 

810
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,880
- She has.
- Fair to say that Jo has had a real rollercoaster of a weekend. 

811
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,800
She's been bumbling through and I think this has lifted her out of the depths. 

812
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:58,040
- Just saved her.
- Because of the flavour. Rob's come in with this and it's just a mess, it's unbaked. 

813
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,360
And even I went round before and said to him, 

814
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,800
"Listen, you've got to get your timings right." 

815
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,760
Now, that, for me, brings him immediately straight into the danger zone. 

816
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,920
- Because you gave him an official warning?
- He's been warned so many times about the same thing. 

817
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,680
- Let's talk about Yasmin.
- It is underdone, slightly, on the side. 

818
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,600
I thought it was stunning on the top, but the peach 

819
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,880
was absolutely lost with the raspberries. 

820
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,240
And her pork pie? She came... Fifth out of seven. 

821
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,280
So is she still hovering around the red danger zone? 

822
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,040
- She's still hovering. Yes, she is. 
- So Jason didn't do have a brilliant day yesterday, did he? 

823
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,120
You look at his pork pies, he was at the bottom. And then you look at the showstopper. 

824
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,520
All you've got is aerated meringue with a taste of plums underneath. 

825
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,360
And you've got no flavour in plums. 

826
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,200
There is no flavour, intrinsically, in a plum. 

827
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,080
It's gutting because he's got so much promise. 

828
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,920
He was star baker, he shared it with Holly last week and he's had it the week before. 

829
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,040
The bakers that we're looking to win are the consistent ones, 

830
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,680
and they have to be consistently good at everything. 

831
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,520
So in the drop zone we have Jason, Rob, Yasmin. 

832
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,560
Will one go or will two? 

833
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,120
THUNDER RUMBLES 

834
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,120
- And the thunder breaks on cue. 
- I think that was Mary. 

835
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,160
LAUGHS 

836
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,280
First of all, well done, you magnificent seven. 

837
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,760
You have grafted so hard 

838
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,960
and we've had the most fantastic pie bake off, so well done. 

839
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,440
Let's start with a resounding positive. 

840
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,880
Now, this week the judges were in total agreement 

841
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,200
as to who should be our star baker. 

842
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,160
And so this week's star baker is... 

843
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,240
..Janet. 

844
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,600
APPLAUSE 

845
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,040
Well done. 

846
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,800
Thank you. 

847
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,560
Unfortunately, you know the drill, 

848
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,120
we can't take all of you on to our next bake off. 

849
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,760
So today we're going to be saying goodbye... 

850
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,760
..to Jason... 

851
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,560
..and to Rob. 

852
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,200
- I'm so sorry, guys. 
- We're sad to see you go. 
- We are very sad to see you go. 

853
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,320
- Bro'...
- Oh, guys, that is a gutter, it's a gutter. 

854
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,160
Rob left today because it was one mistake too many. 

855
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,440
And, in fact, it came to a point a few weeks ago 

856
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,720
where I had to say something and say, "One more big mess-up like that and you're out." 

857
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,480
And unfortunately we had it today. 

858
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:14,000
Jason is 19, but he just didn't have the skills and the background to baking. 

859
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,840
In my industry at the moment there's a lack of youth coming through. 

860
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,880
It was lovely to see the passion they've got for baking. 

861
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,160
Jason's just had a chat with me and said, 

862
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,280
"I think I want to give up design and I want to go into baking." 

863
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,600
And I said, "If that's what you want to do, do it." 

864
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,600
It's just really proven to me that it's something that I'm not only good at, but I really enjoy. 

865
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,640
When I'm doing it, I'm always smiling, 

866
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,040
so hopefully I'll be able to fulfil that dream, and one day, you know, 

867
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,560
look out for me, you'll see me doing something big. 

868
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,680
I'm so gutted. I was really hoping to be in the final four. 

869
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,680
It's meant a lot to me, being in this competition. 

870
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,480
When it's something that you're really passionate about 

871
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,680
it becomes really emotional. 

872
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,560
Yeah, it's hard taking criticism. 

873
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,840
I've learnt loads, so I'm only going to take positives from this. 

874
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,000
I have dodged a bullet. Who'd have thought that? 

875
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,640
I think I got in by the skin of my teeth there. 

876
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,320
I'm very surprised that today I came out on top, and obviously 

877
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,120
my family are going to be really, really pleased, and my friends, too. 

878
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,880
- I got the star baker today. 
- "Oh, well done!" 

879
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,040
Isn't that just crazy? 

880
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,800
Next time, it's an all-ladies quarter-final... 

881
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,520
- What level of stress are we on, between one and ten? 
- Nine-and-three-quarters.
- My Lord! 

882
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,840
Where the remaining five face three challenging desserts: 

883
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,840
- A baked cheesecake... 
- I hope they like it. 

884
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,600
To be honest, there's not a lot I can do about it now. 

885
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:59,520
- Mary Berry's chocolate roulade... 
- This doesn't even count as a roulade, it looks like a disaster.  

886
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,280
No one has got a tight roll. 

887
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,600
And finally, a showstopping French speciality. 

888
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,680
Let's face it, I'm just showing off for the judges. 

889
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,280
- Your creme patisserie is absolutely perfect.
- They are to die for. 

890
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,080
- Who will be crowned Queen of Desserts?
- You've nailed that. 

891
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,320
And who will be knocked out before the semi-final? 

892
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,320
At this stage, it is really difficult to pick between them. 

893
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,600
This is the week to watch. 

894
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,240
The person that very sadly will be leaving us... 

895
