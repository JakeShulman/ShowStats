1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,760
We've got five surviving as we search to find Britain's finest amateur baker.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,320
Last week was pie week, with the bakers busier than Sweeney Todd on a Bank Holiday

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
and a tent piled high with slices of piggy perfection!

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,880
And this week they've got everything to bake for, because at stake - a place in the Bake Off semi-final.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,720
Last week was round five of the bake off.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,480
- What a mess.
- I can't fault it. 
- Janet surprised the judges...

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,400
- That is delicious.
- And herself...

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,680
This is like surgery now.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,800
Yasmin narrowly missed being sent home...

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,320
I got in by the skin of my teeth, I think.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,680
And the young men failed to maintain baking brilliance.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,240
We're going to be saying goodbye to Jason...

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,720
and to Rob.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,800
This week, even higher standards of baking skills are expected.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,840
What level of stress are we on? Give me a number between one and ten.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,080
- Nine and three-quarters. 
- Oh, my Lord.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,400
The five remaining bakers will need to fight for their place in the semi-finals.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,720
This doesn't even count as a roulade.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
It looks like a disaster area.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm just showing off for the judges.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Your creme patisserie is absolutely perfect.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
They are to die for.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
We're on the home straight to find Britain's best amateur baker.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,160
They're overworked and so are their sponges and they've got two days to nail desserts.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,640
I've never nailed a dessert, because the flavour can be a tad metallic.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you nervous, excited?

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Nervous! There are five people in that tent baking desserts for us.

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,040
Why would I be nervous? I was born for this.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
This week, the bakers face their biggest challenge yet.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,840
Tomorrow, one will be crowned star baker

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
and for one, the journey will end.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,400
So, welcome to this all-lady Bake Off quarter final.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,720
Now, cracking on straightaway with your signature bake,

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,880
and today we're asking you to bake, please, a lovely cheesecake.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,520
Judges, Paul and Mary, are looking for a nice, firm, rich, creamy centre,

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,000
- with your choice of flavouring. 
- And you've got 2Â½ hours on the clock

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,360
to complete your signature bake.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,640
- So, just remains for me to say on your marks, get set...
- Bake!

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,640
A baked cheesecake is considered trickier than a simple refrigerated version,

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,480
as it requires perfect execution in a number of complex steps.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,120
There are many things that could go wrong with this bake.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
The crust at the bottom could be all soft.

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,640
The cheesecake mixture itself could be too stiff, or not stiff enough.

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,120
If it's overbaked, it'll most likely crack.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,160
If it's underbaked, when you cut out a portion, it'll all fall apart.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,200
But most importantly of all, it should be wonderful to eat!

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,840
To begin, the bakers create a base.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,520
This is traditionally made from crushed up shop-bought biscuits, like digestives or ginger nuts.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,720
- Just think of someone you don't like. 
- SHE CHUCKLES

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,400
Stupidly, I decided to make biscuits. It's just pushing myself that little bit more.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
It might impress the judges that I've made the extra effort.

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,720
Yasmin is making amaretti biscuits,

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,400
which, after baking and cooling, she will crush to form the base of her amaretto cheesecake.

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
I think I do want to impress this week, because I feel as though until now

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,720
I've kind of gotten through because somebody else has done worse than me

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,200
rather than I have done really well. I want to get through on merit rather than by default, basically.

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,080
So, how are your, your husband and daughter feeling about your, your success?

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,840
Really pleased for me, but I think my daughter is missing...

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,600
- She's missing her mum. 
- Yes. Yes, she...
- Does she understand where you've gone?

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Yes, and I'm not sure she understands why I keep having to go back.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Mary-Anne is also trying something different.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
Instead of using biscuits for her tutti-fruitti cheesecake base,

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,000
- she's making a shortcrust pastry.
- Hi, Mary-Anne.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
- Hello!
- And your pastry base for this, what's in that one then?

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Pastry has got some ground almonds in for a bit of crunch.

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,560
It's got some lemon zest in and it does come out quite biscuity.

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,440
- So you're going to bake that blind first?
- I wasn't going to,

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,960
but after the other flan that I did I think I will, just to make sure and then maybe put an egg wash.

70
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,520
That's a very good idea, because the, the topping will be fairly wet,

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,680
- and if you don't it will go in and be soggy.
- Yeah, so we don't want another soggy bottom.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,760
We don't, we don't do those.

73
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,680
De-de-de-de-de! Get back.

74
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm about to press my base into the tin,

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,120
but I'm aware now that I've used lots of time up because I've made the biscuits.

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,000
On top of her biscuit base, Janet is adding rhubarb...

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
It's nice to have something with a tang at the bottom.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,200
..to make her ginger and rhubarb baked cheesecake.

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,640
- Is the rhubarb going into your mixture or is it in a layer? 
- No. No, it's just a layer

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,920
on top of the ginger.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,280
I was going to puree it and then I thought bad mistake, cos it could be too wet and flood out.

82
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,520
And I think the very clever thing is the way that she's doing a wheel effect,

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
- which when you cut it... 
- Yes.
- ..you will get the rhubarb in a long strip, which is fine

84
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,520
- because it's very difficult to cut across a stick of rhubarb.
- Right.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,320
The next step for the bakers is to make their flavoured cheese topping.

86
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,840
The texture of the mixture can vary.

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,880
Heavy ingredients can lead to a dense cheesecake topping.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,960
Whilst a lighter mixture can be achieved by folding in whisked egg whites.

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm making curd cheese to go into my cheesecake.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,120
It's very simple.

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,960
You just heat milk to boiling and add lemon juice and almost instantly curds form.

92
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,640
You let it cool down a bit and drain the whey from the curds and cheese. There you go.

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Let's face it, I'm just showing off for the judges, so... SHE LAUGHS

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Because I can!

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,920
The cheesecake that I'm making is quite a quick cheesecake

96
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,480
and I wanted it to be able to chill it properly.

97
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,440
Jo is racing ahead with a simple classic rum and raisin cheesecake,

98
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,880
which only takes 15 minutes to prepare.

99
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,520
You're not hanging round, are you?

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,040
- No.
- Is this your last job then? 
- Yep.
- Is that it!

101
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,920
And then it's just finished off with some sour cream ten minutes before

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,800
the end, just to give it that little finish on top.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
Jo, put your feet up! What will you do for two hours?

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
- I wanted one that would chill, so I could get it chilled properly.
- So that you can chill too.

105
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
You'll be finished in about 20 minutes?

106
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,520
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Put your feet up. Have a little rum.
- Thanks, Jo.

107
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,280
- Yep.
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys. 
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,600
The last contestant in the quarter final is Holly.

109
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,760
She's hoping her festive cheesecake will be a hit with the judges.

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,000
This cheesecake is for Father Christmas.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
It's what we leave out instead of mince pies,

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,600
- cos Father Christmas, when he comes to our house, prefers cheesecake.
- Does he?
- He does.

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,480
It has semolina and almonds, brandy, Christmas spices and tangerine and lemon as well.

114
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
This will be quite dense.

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Yeah, at this stage it's very dense.

116
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,240
But it, it, it has a lightness, because I'm also going to fold in egg whites.

117
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
- Lucky Father Christmas! Yes.
- Look forward to trying it then.

118
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,040
- See you.
- Thanks very much, Holly. 
- Thank you.

119
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,440
OK, Team Oestrogen, you've got one hour remaining! One hour remaining!

120
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,640
A perfect cheesecake is ready to come out of the oven when the centre slightly wobbles.

121
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,840
Baking time is paramount to its success.

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,120
Say your prayers. Pray it works.

123
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,600
Our bakers are fortunate enough to have an unlimited supply of eggs, butter, cream, cheese and fruit.

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,600
However, once upon a time, desserts needed an awful lot of imagination - several very strange ingredients.

125
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
As food supplies diminished during World War II

126
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,800
and creating traditional desserts became impossible, the bakers of Britain needed to become creative.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
It was time to bake for victory.

128
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,840
During the war, making desserts was particularly difficult.

129
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Housewives found that their pre-war recipe books were useless,

130
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,000
they might as well have chucked them in the bin,

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,800
because they would say things like, "Take six eggs, take half a pint of cream,"

132
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
you know, "take butter", all this sort of thing.

133
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Couldn't take any of those things!

134
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,200
Favourite desserts were almost impossible

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,840
to make, like lemon meringue pies, spotted dick, roly poly pudding.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,080
So, really housewives had to use an enormous amount of imagination and ingenuity to create a dessert at all!

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,160
Faced with a nation that had become dependent on a limited number of ingredients,

138
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,520
in 1940, the Ministry of Food began to communicate alternative recipes and new approaches to baking.

139
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,960
Britain had to become much more self-sufficient.

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,320
And so the Ministry of Food was very anxious to encourage people

141
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
to grow vegetables in their back gardens

142
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,040
and what you grew in your back garden started to find its way onto your dessert menu.

143
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Sometimes this would mean soft fruit like raspberries

144
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,280
and gooseberries, but it also, of course, meant vegetables.

145
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,840
The Ministry of Food published recipes detailing how to make tasty desserts

146
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,400
using potatoes instead of flour and vegetables as sweeteners.

147
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,600
One government tip was to use liquid paraffin instead of lard.

148
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,160
This suggestion had rather unfortunate consequences, as paraffin acts as a laxative.

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,880
Vegetables appeared in numerous mock recipes as substitutes for scarce ingredients.

150
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Parsnips replaced bananas, chocolate truffles were made from mashed potato, and one of the most famous

151
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,840
mock desserts in the kitchens of Britain was the mock apricot flan.

152
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,720
The apricot part of it is carrot,

153
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,840
flavoured with plum jam and almond flavour.

154
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,760
The pastry case, in this instance, will be made with mashed potato.

155
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,480
So, the idea would be that you would be encouraged to cook several things at once.

156
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,040
So, you would cook more potato than you'd need for your meal, and then make this with leftover potato.

157
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,520
Putting the cooked mashed potato in does make it quite a difficult pastry to work with.

158
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,200
It makes it quite soft and sticky.

159
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,320
Using boiled carrots and plum jam as a substitute for apricots

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,640
was a unique concept for the housewives of Britain.

161
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,200
Although this has the colour of apricots and the flavour, it doesn't entirely look like apricots.

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,360
Mock dishes didn't necessarily totally look like the things

163
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,040
that they were supposed to be, they just reminded you either the shape, the colour, the taste, the texture.

164
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,920
And if you hadn't eaten apricots for ten years, then you might be quite pleased to have something like this

165
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
put in front of you, because it would remind you of the apricots.

166
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,960
Just half an hour till I can eat five cheesecakes!

167
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,160
Sorry, that was my internal monologue there. Half an hour, please! Half an hour!

168
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,280
It's about the bake. It's about the time in the oven.

169
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,520
So they're all watching their oven every five minutes to make sure everything's OK.

170
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,800
- OK. Mary, would you agree with that? 
- Yes. Overbaking is the main thought.

171
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,720
You've got to catch it at the right moment, and it goes on cooking a little once it's out of the oven.

172
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,560
- Overcooking means that it will open out in a crack.
- But it's tricky.

173
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,640
At the end of the day, this is the quarter finals now,

174
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,480
- and any screw-ups from anybody, they've gone.
- They're out.

175
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
I want to do my best and I don't want to make stupid mistakes.

176
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,520
I would hate to sort of

177
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,200
fail just because I haven't made the effort I could have made, you know?

178
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,560
Cos one thing I say to the kids at school, just always do your best, and everybody's best is different.

179
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
You know, you can't always be the best,

180
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,920
but you can always do your best and, and that's all I'm hoping to do, you know?

181
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Sensitive to temperature, cracks can develop when

182
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,640
the outside of the cheesecake is exposed to more heat than the centre.

183
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,160
I cooked it in a water bath today so that it hopefully won't crack on the top.

184
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,160
As water can only reach 100 degrees Centigrade before turning to steam, the water bath regulates

185
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,760
the temperature evenly across the cheesecake and prevents the outside from overcooking.

186
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,640
- Chilling.
- You've already done it? 
- Yes, I've done it. 
- She's unbelievable.

187
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,760
- How does she do it, Janet? 
- I've no idea.

188
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,120
She was sitting looking demure and elegant before I'd even crushed my silly biscuits, so.

189
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,120
- I've never looked elegant or demure in my life. 
- Well, I beg to differ.

190
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,840
Excellent.

191
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah, I was going to take it out, but I'm thinking it's got a little bit too much jiggle now.

192
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,520
It's supposed to have a little bit of movement in the middle, but...

193
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm going to put it back in.

194
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,520
Another five minutes and hope the pastry doesn't catch.

195
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,000
BEEPING

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,640
Famous last words!

197
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,600
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

198
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,960
- Oh, 15?
- 15, Janet. 15.

199
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
(15.)

200
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,600
So, pray it doesn't all collapse in the middle.

201
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,120
Smells OK!

202
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,400
Smells reasonably Christmassy!

203
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,320
The question is to glaze or not to glaze. I've got some lemon jelly marmalade that I've warmed up.

204
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
I don't, I don't know.

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,560
It looks like nothing's happening, but I'm fizzing in here, you know,

206
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,880
with 101 things - should I do this? Then, don't mess with it. Well, maybe I should...

207
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,200
It looks good!

208
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm happy. Whether anybody else will be happy is a whole other thing.

209
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,120
One minute to go!

210
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
One minute to go, everybody!

211
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,720
Ooh, a bit crumbly.

212
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,840
- Careful! Careful! Careful!
- I know. I don't know how to do it!

213
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,160
- Mel, come away.
- Sorry, Hel.
- Oh, God!

214
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,280
It's gone and cracked in the middle.

215
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,960
So annoying.

216
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,560
Get in.

217
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,120
Rrr! How annoying.

218
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,560
Bakers, your time is up.

219
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,240
The bakers have done all they can.

220
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,160
It's now down to the judges to decide which cheesecakes will reach their high expectations.

221
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
- We're hungry, you know?
- Mary-Anne. 
- Hi, Mary-Anne.

222
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
I must say, I really, I really like the filling.

223
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
You've got something quite unusual.

224
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
I love the flavours that you've got on there.

225
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
Lovely brown pastry, pale golden underneath.

226
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,240
The overall appearance is a bit rough and ready, you know,

227
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,560
where it's joined at the bottom and the sides.

228
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,320
This is the same for a lot of your stuff. You're nearly there and then you lose it on these things.

229
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,040
- I thought I was doing well with this. 
- Now, Mary-Anne, when you're baking blind...
- Mmm.

230
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,240
- ..you put it in half-baked, then you take the beans out.
- Mmm.

231
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,920
That is the time to get a knife and level it off all the way round

232
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,840
- and you wouldn't have this higgledy-piggledy side to it.
- Right.

233
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,000
It's got a very nice flavour and you've achieved

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,760
a good crust on the base.

235
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,640
- For me, it's overbaked, which has made it quite dry.
- Yes.

236
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,560
It's just a little bit thick.

237
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,240
- Claggy.
- Yeah.
- I think you put semolina. Was it semolina?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
You get the crunch from that, which has taken away the texture of a cheesecake

239
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,080
which should be quite smooth and glossy.

240
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,160
I think Father Christmas should like it with a good dollop of cream.

241
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,160
Your base wasn't quite packed enough.

242
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
- OK. 
- Maybe a little bit more butter...

243
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,040
just to bind it, cos it's broken down to nothing.

244
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,680
It's absolutely delicious.

245
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,000
You've got a lovely bake. The flavour's good.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And it's so delicate. Actually, the rum and raisin is perfect,

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,200
cos you haven't overwhelmed the alcohol, cos it's so easily done.

248
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,920
- And I love the cream topping. 
- Thanks, Mary.

249
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,720
Yes, you've got quite a thick crust on the bottom,

250
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,600
and there's a little bit of a problem with the baking, of getting it out, haven't you?

251
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,240
It's overbaked on the outside. It could do a tiny bit longer in the middle.

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,480
It tastes like a baked egg custard to me.

253
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,000
It's almost split. It's got that texture of scrambled egg.

254
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Janet, I love you.

255
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,200
You've nailed that.

256
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,600
- Really?
- The flavour of that is absolutely beautiful.

257
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,800
It's as light as a feather.

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,000
- Could I be critical about the top? 
- Yeah, you can.

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,160
I could, but I think it's down to the fact that there's just so much on there.

260
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,080
It's nothing to do with the bake. Ah!

261
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,760
It's like fairies skipping on the tongue. That is great.

262
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
- That is stunning. It's like a souffle.
- Thank you. 
- How many would that serve?

263
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
Quite a lot, don't you think? 12?

264
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,720
I don't know. 12! Not in our house.

265
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,360
Two in mine. That's an intimate dinner, Mary, for me.

266
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,600
It looks stunning.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I just don't get it at all, you know?

268
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,600
Just can't tell you how amazed I am, cos I don't do things imagining

269
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
they're ever going to be any good.

270
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,080
So, it's a sort of complete fluke and like utter amazement.

271
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,200
I can't tell how I've done, because they liked some bits and didn't like other bits.

272
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,040
And it was the same for everybody, I think.

273
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,920
It's quite even, apart from Janet, who completely shone.

274
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,400
Janet's obviously safe, but the rest of us aren't particularly.

275
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,200
The signature bake is designed to show the bakers' individuality.

276
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,080
The next challenge is, by contrast, strictly controlled.

277
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,760
Time for the next bake, which is, of course, our favourite.

278
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,320
It's that old Technical Challenge.

279
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,200
Now, Mary and Paul, of course, will judge this blind.

280
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,240
- So, Mary, Paul, please leave the tent. Thanks very much.
- Good luck.

281
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,360
So, today's Technical Challenge is...

282
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,880
to make a chocolate roulade, OK?

283
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,080
So, we're asking for a nice, thin sponge, neatly filled, and neatly rolled.

284
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,560
This is a difficult challenge this one.

285
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,480
You've got one and a quarter hours before serving it up

286
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,840
to King Hollywood and Queen Berry of judging. Good luck.

287
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
- On your marks, get set...
- Bake!

288
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,720
For this challenge, the bakers have been given a simplified recipe.

289
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,120
They will rely on their own skill and baking knowledge to produce a winning roulade.

290
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,200
What makes a great chocolate roulade?

291
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
You've got to get a well-risen mixture.

292
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,440
It should have these sort of informal cracks on it and a tight roll.

293
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
I think the bakers may be in real trouble when it comes to the rolling.

294
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
Some of them haven't made it before and I think they'll be trying to sort of rush it.

295
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,480
That will be a problem for them and they'll end up with one that doesn't look quite as beautiful as that.

296
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Have you ever made one of these before?

297
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,720
I was starting to think that it sounds like I don't bake at all,

298
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,360
cos every Technical Challenge, "I've never made one of these before."

299
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,720
- Have you made a roulade before? 
- I have, back in the day at school.

300
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,600
It was my nemesis!

301
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,640
Unlike a normal chocolate sponge, this recipe contains no flour, fat or raising agents.

302
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,040
Instead, the rise is created by folding in whipped egg whites, which create a light and fluffy texture.

303
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,640
You can knock the air out of them.

304
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,040
They need to be really light and airy.

305
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,680
Just cutting it with a, a metal spoon rather than

306
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,000
a plastic one, because that takes a lot of air out the plastic one.

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,640
Well, that's what I've always been taught anyway.

308
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,040
Egg whites consist of strands of protein.

309
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,760
When whipped, they form a network that traps and holds air.

310
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,920
- So, you need to beat it on so it's not streaky?
- Make sure that the egg is incorporated

311
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,040
- and you don't get...
- Strips of white.
- ..big lumps of white, yes.

312
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,200
To produce an even sponge suitable for rolling, the bakers

313
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,320
need to make sure the chocolate mixture is level in the tin.

314
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,280
I don't want to take any of the air away by patting it too much.

315
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,440
Oh, go on, get in the corner. Stop being silly.

316
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,960
- I think I'm going to try gentle encouragement.
- A gentle waft.

317
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
Encouragement into the corners.

318
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,880
Unlike the depth of a standard cake, the thin base of a roulade requires less time to cook.

319
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,560
Overbaking and underbaking could prove fatal, making the roulade difficult to roll.

320
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,480
30 minutes to go, bakers!

321
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,240
Half an hour left of roulade-making fun.

322
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm trying to get rid of the sort of wet look on the top, you know,

323
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,120
in case it's a bit that hasn't baked, you know?

324
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,600
And that looks OK, I think.

325
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,040
It's a little bit uneven, but that's the problem with fatless sponges.

326
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,920
I think they're quite hard to smooth over cos they don't have that fat to kind of even out as it, as it melts.

327
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,240
The recipe states the sponge should remain in the tin until it's cool.

328
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
The tin will help the sponge keep its shape and stop it drying out.

329
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,680
- Well, it's looking a bit moist. 
- However, with time against them,

330
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,680
the bakers know that the hot metal will slow the cooling process down.

331
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,640
You can't roll cold cream into a warm sponge cos it will just get awfully messy.

332
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,480
If it were me I'd take it out now, but that's not what the recipe says, so...

333
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,400
I've got a, a sneaky feeling that if we leave it in the tin to get cold it might not be roll-up-able.

334
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I'm thinking it needs to go in the freezer, to be honest.

335
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,840
- Mmm.
- Let me ask you a question... 
- Lady Mary Berry. Yes.

336
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,640
- the answer of which may, may resolve the dilemma.
- Yes.

337
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,240
This is Mary Berry's recipe, more than likely.

338
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,120
Do you think you should change it?

339
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm going to try and roll it up and let it cool and then unroll it to put the cream in.

340
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,960
Probably doing exactly the wrong thing, but we'll see.

341
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,800
Janet is confusing the roulade technique with that of a Swiss roll.

342
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,640
Ah! Oh, my giddy aunt.

343
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,080
Swiss roll sponge contains flour, making it more pliable when warm.

344
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,360
It's so hot! What sort of hands are you supposed to have?

345
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,880
A roulade sponge is delicate and needs to cool before rolling.

346
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,520
But I'm not sure. This is pure invention.

347
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,720
OK, just five minutes to roll out the roulade! Five minutes!

348
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Once the sponges have cooled, it's time for the bakers to tackle the trickiest part of the process.

349
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,040
The secret of getting that lovely spiral is just about half an inch from the end,

350
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,440
you cut through the chocolate roulade,

351
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,880
you put a thick layer of cream on the top,

352
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,600
then you bend that over and break it.

353
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,120
So, you start the spiral and then lift the paper

354
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,280
and let it roll to the end and then you tip it on like that.

355
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
Can't go wrong.

356
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,360
There was a, a thing I remember reading centuries ago where you snip a little bit.

357
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,440
Just cutting a notch to help start the rolling.

358
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,680
This is the scary bit.

359
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
Ooh and it's cracking!

360
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,320
Oh, dear.

361
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,000
I need some Mary Berry advice, that's what I need!

362
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's absolutely dreadful.

363
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,680
OK, bakers, you've got one minute left.

364
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,920
There is a trick to this, but I don't think I've got the secret.

365
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,840
It doesn't look great, does it?

366
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,240
Do you think I could cover that with icing sugar? They won't notice, will they?

367
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,680
No. Oy vey!

368
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,560
Arh!

369
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What a fool, what a fool, what a fool.

370
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,720
Needs a corset,

371
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,160
that's what it needs.

372
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,800
I think it looks all right.

373
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,840
It's about the untidiest, hideous-est roulade she'll ever have seen.

374
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,280
This doesn't even count as a roulade.

375
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,840
It looks like a disaster area.

376
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,720
OK, that's time up or, as we say in the roulade business, log out.

377
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,920
What? I'm only a messenger.

378
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,280
As with all the technical challenges, Mary and Paul are never present during the bake.

379
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:14,880
They are unaware of which baker is responsible for which of the five roulades that sit before them.

380
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,840
Well, all of them have this problem with rolling up.

381
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,520
No-one has got a tight roll.

382
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,640
I quite like the look of this one.

383
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,520
- It's quite tasty that one. 
- Mmm, it's very good.

384
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,200
- It has broken up a lot. 
- It's not bad. No. 
- But they've tried to do a swirl.

385
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,320
The overall appearance of it looks quite nice, though.

386
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,360
This one looks a bit of a mess. It's cracked so much that the cream's oozing out on top.

387
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,560
- Flavour's good.
- Flavour's good.

388
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,120
I enjoy chocolate roulade.

389
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,600
Now this one looks nice. Slightly cracked.

390
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600
- It's got a nice taste.
- Mmm.

391
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,800
- There's, there's a little bit of a bend there.
- Yes. This one's made quite a bit of effort

392
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,040
- to get a good roll.
- Yeah.

393
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,480
- Mmm, that's good, isn't it? 
- That's nice, yeah.
- Mmm.

394
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,960
- The decoration on it looks quite nice. It's got a bit of a curl here. 
- And just a few cracks.

395
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
But a good rise here.

396
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah.

397
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,760
This one's has a sort of fairly major crack across the top.

398
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,960
Just lines of sponge and cream.

399
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,520
They all taste very good. We can't be too critical of the flavour. They're very, very similar.

400
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,480
That's what you've got to understand, the judging will be made

401
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,000
on how it's been rolled up, cos the taste is all pretty much identical so it'll be purely based on that.

402
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,960
Mary and Paul will now rank the roulades, starting with the worst.

403
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,320
The person in fifth place is this one.

404
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,560
- Highs and lows, Janet.
- Unlucky.

405
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,280
It was sort of weird actually, because I rolled it up once as a practice run and it was fine.

406
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,320
That was a major mistake to roll it up first and re-roll it.

407
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,680
- Silly. Sorry.
- Number four is here.

408
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,800
Had a big crack round the middle.

409
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,680
But, of course, the flavour was lovely, it's just the rolling up.

410
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,440
And in third spot we've chosen this one.

411
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,760
A major cut across the top. Not as much rolling.

412
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,800
There's a little bit of a bend, but it has given way.

413
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,440
And number two is here.

414
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,920
- Me.
- The little sieved cocoa on the top made a nice finish.

415
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,760
And quite neatly rolled up, but not quite tight enough.

416
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
So, obviously

417
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,560
- the winner, Jo. Well, done. 
- Well, done, Jo!

418
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,960
You've managed, you've managed to get a nice roll

419
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,920
and there's even an attempt to make a roll inside as well, so well done.

420
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,200
When they was getting to number three I was thinking, "I'll take third. that's OK."

421
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
Then it was not three. I was thinking, "Two. Two's better than three."

422
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,720
Then there was one and I was like, "Oh, my God, I'm first!" Fantastic!

423
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm not best baker. I'm not worst, but in the middle is still dangerous,

424
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,440
because in the middle with five people is quite close to the bottom.

425
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,760
Just put so much pressure on tomorrow.

426
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:11,240
Wouldn't mind so much if it was something that I was really good at tomorrow, but it's not.

427
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,400
It's the last day of the quarter final.

428
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,080
Just one challenge remains before Paul and Mary decide which baker will be going home.

429
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,440
So, two challenges down, who do we think's looking in trouble?

430
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,960
I actually think Holly's in trouble, which is...

431
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,400
which is a bit of a shock.

432
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,120
But on the other hand, she's been right down and she can pull right up.

433
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,400
- Mary-Anne?
- Again, another one in the danger zone, wouldn't you say?

434
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,280
She's in the danger again. She's quite good at pulling up.

435
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,680
Yasmin. She had a sort of middling, middling couple of challenges.

436
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,320
- Yasmin, again, is in the danger... 
- Not so good.
- There's a few of them down there!

437
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
But then you've gone from Janet...

438
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,480
Janet's gone from the top to the bottom. She has a poor one today,

439
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
she's straight in there as well.

440
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,480
It's Jo that really did the best over the first two challenges.

441
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,760
- She had a great day. 
- For me, Jo's the only safe one.

442
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
Good morning, Famous Five.

443
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,120
Hope you're all doing well, feeling fresh.

444
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,000
This is, of course, Showstopper Challenge day, and really it's your

445
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,880
last chance to prove that you should have a place in the semi-final of the Great British Bake Off.

446
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,760
This challenge is to make a croquembouche-inspired bake

447
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,640
that's really going to impress Paul and Mary.

448
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,400
You've got five hours to complete this Showstopper Challenge, so all that remains to say...

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,840
- OK, fabulous fembots, on your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

450
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,200
Traditionally served at French weddings, a croquembouche, literally translated as

451
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,040
"crunch in the mouth", is a spectacular tower of choux pastry buns

452
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,880
held together with hardened caramel.

453
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,240
This particular challenge is fantastic.

454
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,720
You're dealing in lots and lots of profiteroles that all have to be

455
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,480
exact colour, exact shape, and, finally, exact flavour inside.

456
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,880
The assembly is going to be extremely difficult and then the final decoration.

457
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,160
It's a really difficult challenge and I wish them well and I can't wait for the results.

458
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:31,400
- A few months ago if somebody said to me, "Can you just, just whip up... 
- Knock up.
- "..108 choux buns."

459
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,680
I'd have gone, "You're off your rocker."

460
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,240
- Tell me about your culinary disasters this week.
- Oh, collapsing piles of profiteroles and...

461
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,800
- A flat choux.
- Yeah.

462
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,240
More like a pump.

463
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,680
For the profiteroles, the bakers need to make choux pastry.

464
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,840
First, butter is melted into a large amount of water...

465
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,680
I wish this would hurry up and boil.

466
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,760
Then flour is stirred in until a firm paste is formed.

467
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,400
This will be my fourth time I've made this now, so I feel like I've practiced quite a lot.

468
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,920
Apparently, the one that I made on Sunday is still standing in the fridge, half of it anyway,

469
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,120
so that's a good sign. Uh!

470
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,760
Jo is making a limoncello and white chocolate croquembouche,

471
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,520
covered in caramel and topped with spun sugar.

472
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,800
So, what have you got over at the end here?

473
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,600
My choux pastry is cooling down on a stone and then I'll add my eggs into it after that.

474
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,680
- We see all sorts of different processes. That's brand new to me.
- Oh, really?

475
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Yes. I would just leave it in the pan and then put it to one side on a cold surface. It's going to work.

476
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,480
It's your way of doing it.

477
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,000
When the paste has cooled, beaten egg yolks are mixed in a little at a time.

478
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,320
The bakers must gauge when the mixture has reached the perfect glossy texture

479
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,200
which means its ready for piping.

480
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,080
The thing is to get the right consistency, not too sloppy and not too stiff.

481
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,040
Janet is making a vanilla and orange zest croquembouche, presented on a nougatine base.

482
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,040
There are certain things where you can be a bit more cavalier and do what you want, you know?

483
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,800
But I think with something like this, you do have to be a bit more precise, you know, really.

484
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,400
I am making a black forest gateaux croquembouche

485
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,960
with a gingerbread house and snowy scene inside.

486
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,320
So, I'm calling it Hansel and Gretel's Croquembouche.

487
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,240
Holly is putting a new twist on this French classic.

488
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,960
Instead of using caramel, her croquembouche will be held together with dark chocolate.

489
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,640
At Christmas, I'd never make something just for the adults,

490
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,040
I'd make something the children could have too.

491
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,320
- You're the perfect mum. 
- Gosh, I'm really not.

492
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,520
You're the only one doing a double-narrative croquembouche.

493
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,240
- I mean, that is quite something. I'm looking forward to it. 
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

494
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,800
OK, I think the flavours in there will be spectacular.

495
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,160
The idea of the cherry, the black forest theme, will be beautiful.

496
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,160
My only concern is how is it will bond without the use of caramel.

497
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,400
Come on, don't mess around.

498
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,840
Fiddly is not the word.

499
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,600
We're going to try for dainty.

500
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,160
The jury's out on whether it'll actually come off, but we're going to try.

501
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,520
Mary-Anne is making an orange and praline croquembouche,

502
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,360
held together with cardamom-flavoured caramel.

503
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,920
Just where I've finished piping, it's stuck up in a little cone.

504
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm just using a damp finger to dab it down

505
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,840
so that it doesn't stick up and burn.

506
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,040
An hour into the showstopper bake and the first of many batches of choux buns go into the oven.

507
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,440
Choux pastry puffs up in the oven when the moisture evaporates.

508
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,760
Holly has a method that intensifies this process.

509
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,000
Basically, in the oven, the water turns into steam

510
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,680
and makes the pastry rise better, I think.

511
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,960
That's the theory anyway.

512
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Out of the oven, the bakers prick their profiteroles to release the steam.

513
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,280
This prevents the buns from going soggy.

514
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,200
So now these, I'm looking around the room, mine are a lot darker than everybody else's.

515
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Not bothered. I'm not fazed.

516
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
I like the colour.

517
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,760
Next, the bakers need to make their creme patisserie filling.

518
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,160
This is a French custard that has the addition of flour to stabilise it.

519
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,400
My creme patisserie for my croquembouche is flavoured with rose syrup,

520
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,080
because it's a favoured flavour in my house

521
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,040
and it looks really pretty.

522
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,280
The custard comes out a pink colour because of the syrup.

523
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,840
Yasmin's rose croquembouche will be covered in caramel

524
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,080
and decorated with sugared almonds.

525
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,480
Has she added pink colouring to this? Look.

526
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,960
- Look at this violent pink. 
- Yes, I know. I watched.

527
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,600
This is creme patissiere with cream,

528
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,640
whipped double cream, and then it's got limoncello, lemon zest

529
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,560
and 300 grams of white chocolate running through it as well.

530
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,160
Jo's adding cream to her filling in the hope it will make the texture lighter.

531
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,880
Bakers, this is your halftime shout-out. You've got two and a half hours to go.

532
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,240
With so many choux buns to fill, the bakers need to maintain focus and momentum.

533
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,280
It's all quite lots of repetitive stuff.

534
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
Ow!

535
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,200
No time for slacking, that's for sure.

536
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,200
Inside this tent you've got five bakers baking desserts entirely from scratch.

537
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,200
However, post-war, Britain took on a very new approach to baking,

538
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,240
as technological advances in food production meant a rise in convenience baking.

539
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,320
Modern-day convenience foods are embraced by the nation.

540
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,440
It's estimated that the readymade dessert industry is worth Â£1.8 billion.

541
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,680
And some of the country's biggest manufacturers produce over seven million desserts a year.

542
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,960
But back in the 1950s, before these convenience foods were available,

543
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,040
British housewives had the desire to create delicious puddings, but lacked the necessary skills.

544
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,320
During the war, so many women were working in factories or on the fields that their offspring

545
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,400
were relatively de-skilled, and especially when it came to

546
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,680
very specific kinds of cooking, like baking,

547
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,800
they really couldn't keep up with previous generations.

548
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,400
These new housewives, even though they're struggling, are still expected to put a delicious pudding

549
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,840
on the table at the end of dinner, so that's where they really needed a helping hand.

550
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,000
The solution came in the form of pre-packaged meals that had been

551
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,520
developed by food manufacturers for the troops during the war.

552
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,040
By the 1960s, as they began to appear in the kitchens of Britain,

553
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,960
a new generation of domestic goddesses appeared and the age of convenience baking was born.

554
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,680
This is the era of the prepacked, the plastic-wrapped, and it's there to help

555
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,280
the woman who wants to slough off the perceived drudgery of cooking.

556
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,800
So, now you can get hold of all sorts of packet mixes

557
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
for instant whips and desserts and delights,

558
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,040
and, of course, the kind of ubiquitous late 1960s pudding,

559
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,240
the lemon meringue pie, where you did in fact have to still bake the case.

560
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
You also had to make the meringue, but the lemon curdy bit,

561
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,040
which was quite complicated, in the middle, came out of a packet.

562
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,160
And that was the great magic of the packet mix, that you could pretend that you weren't really cheating,

563
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,280
because you had to add an egg or a bit of lemon juice or a bit of milk and whisk it yourself.

564
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,640
The home freezer, first patented in 1923, only started to become affordable

565
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,560
to the masses in the 1970s, having a direct impact on the type of convenience desserts available.

566
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,280
Once more people had freezers at home, they no longer had to rely

567
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,200
on packet mixes, they could buy the readymade article direct from the supermarket.

568
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,840
Whether that's a Black Forest gateau, or a baked Alaska,

569
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,800
it just comes straight out, defrost and straight onto the table no effort whatsoever.

570
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,240
Part of the appeal of frozen desserts is that those kind of foods

571
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,600
are exactly the ones that it takes longest to make. They're finickety,

572
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,080
they require a certain amount of knowledge to bake.

573
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,920
And, therefore, frozen puddings were ideal for busy housewives who didn't want to spend all day cooking.

574
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,240
With over 98% of the British population eating a readymade dessert last year,

575
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,920
it would seem our love for convenience is as evident as our love for the desserts themselves.

576
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,240
A croquembouche can take up to a day to bake and assemble.

577
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,120
Our bakers have only an hour to go.

578
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,160
The caramel that binds the profiteroles together is the next big challenge.

579
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,520
I've done three lots of this at home. One lot really worked well...

580
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,320
and the other two didn't.

581
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,680
It's made by melting sugar to around 175 degrees.

582
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,520
In the pan, it must be shaken but not stirred.

583
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,760
Sugar always wants to return to its natural form and if you

584
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,240
start with granulated sugar, that's what it's gonna try and get back to.

585
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,800
So, if you stir it, it does something to the sugar crystals and

586
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,560
they just all go voom and within seconds you've got a solid lump.

587
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,240
And any tips on not burning my fingers, cos I've done a lot of that as well.

588
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,680
How much caramel or sugar are you gonna use here?

589
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,280
I'm going to make a big amount.

590
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,360
- When you bring it out, do you put it in cold water to stop it? 
- No, I haven't been.

591
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,800
OK. It's a good tip though, to stop it burning more, cos it'll carry on...especially a large amount.

592
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,080
Once it's melted, caramel can turn from golden brown and delicious

593
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,520
to burnt and bitter in the blink of an eye.

594
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,320
It could go at any time!

595
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,440
We smell burning sugar.

596
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,880
Is that me? No, it isn't me.

597
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,120
Yes, I've burnt my sugar, my first lot. It's just gone over.

598
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,200
It was fine when I took it off, but as...

599
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,360
because there's so much of it, and I didn't get it in the water

600
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,440
quick enough, it hasn't cooled quick enough. So I'm making a second lot.

601
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,960
It's just like an amber pot of burning liquid.

602
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,360
With the caramel nearly twice as hot as boiling water, the bakers need to work with a great deal of care.

603
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,360
It's so hard not to burn your fingers though.

604
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,440
Ow. Ah!

605
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,920
Not only has Yasmin burnt her fingers, she's also ruined her

606
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,600
second attempt at making her caramel by splashing tap water into the pan.

607
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,680
I just wanna cry.

608
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,960
- Well, you can't help it! It's an unstable thing, isn't it?
- Mmm.

609
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,840
It's all right! You know, it's difficult.

610
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,160
This finger?

611
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,120
Yeah.

612
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,600
OK, that's 30 minutes, 30 minutes, until your croques are in my bouche!

613
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,280
Janet and Mary-Anne are going the extra mile

614
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,040
by making a nougatine base for their desserts

615
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,720
with flaked almonds and caramel.

616
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,360
I'm going to leave you in peace.

617
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,800
- And when it gets a bit cooler you can use your fingers.
- Yes.

618
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,600
Before the nougatine cools and becomes too brittle,

619
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,960
they mould it into the shapes they need for their bases.

620
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,400
It's terribly hot, cos it's caramel, isn't it?

621
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,160
I won't let it win.

622
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,800
The bakers must now start to build their towers.

623
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,360
I did practise with a cone and it was, oh, very... it wasn't a pretty sight. It collapsed.

624
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,200
So I'm going to build it freehand.

625
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,720
I figured that if things were going to go wrong I could see them and make adjustments.

626
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,080
Jo and Yasmin have both chosen to use a metal cone.

627
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,280
- You're filling the inside of the cone?
- Yes.

628
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,280
- And then you'll take the cone off? 
- Yes.

629
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,840
I thought what you had to do was stick them on to the cone.

630
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,760
Oh, really?

631
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,960
Holly is making her own disposable paper cone.

632
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,400
With chocolate, it's so hard to get out, so you actually need to unpeel it, I think, to make it work.

633
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,280
Quarter of an hour left, bakers!

634
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,480
That's 15 minutes left!

635
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,920
Mmm, that's OK.

636
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,920
It's traditional for a croquembouche to be decorated with spun sugar.

637
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,960
Oh, that's good! Look, that's good!

638
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,160
'This is made by flicking liquid caramel until it forms hair-like strands.'

639
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,640
At home I'm a bit worried flicking it. Here, I might just flick it, because I haven't got to clear it.

640
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,760
You can only do what you can do.

641
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,760
There's no point in me pretending I'm amazing.

642
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,520
Just do the best I can.

643
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,600
For the bakers using cones, it's the moment of truth.

644
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,840
Have you got any longer ones of these?

645
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,320
OK, bakers, you've got one minute left!

646
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,400
The 60-second countdown has begun.

647
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,800
Don't fall off, please.

648
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,880
APPLAUSE

649
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,520
- Yeah!
- Ah, my fingers!

650
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,560
Let's see.

651
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,880
- Now, this is the big moment. Is it gonna fit?
- No.

652
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,440
It's like the hair of Rapunzel.

653
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,800
Ah!

654
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,640
OK, everyone, that's time up, please! Time up, everyone!

655
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,480
If you'd like to bring your croquembouche to the end of your benches!

656
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,800
I did everything that I could do and, apart from burning myself,

657
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,120
I'd probably do the same again.

658
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,240
I think my choux buns were quite crisp.

659
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,720
That was my major worry. I'm hoping they've stood up to being filled.

660
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,320
I think I did my best, given the time constraints.

661
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,800
It's a miniature version of what I wanted to do, really.

662
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,000
I hope they think it's a good effort.

663
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,040
I'm all ears as to whether they like the flavour combinations,

664
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,720
but they can't really rain on my parade.

665
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,040
Jo's tower is caving in and beginning to lose its shape.

666
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,840
So disappointed.

667
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,120
I just thought I was gonna have one week where I wasn't gonna be bottom of something again.

668
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,720
So, bakers, it's time for your succulent towers of delight to be judged.

669
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,320
So, what do we have here?

670
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,600
A bit of a deconstructed tower, by the looks of it.

671
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:11,520
Should have just used the creme patissiere, but I wanted it to be a lighter cream. But...

672
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,680
- Mmm.
- I realise now that was obviously the wrong thing.

673
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,840
You've answered your own question.

674
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,920
- I know.
- You were asked to do a tower and it really is for an event, for an occasion,

675
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,840
- and it's got to stand up when the guests are here.
- Yeah.

676
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,360
So, just remember, no cream with a creme patissiere.

677
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,520
- Mmm.
- They are to die for.

678
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:38,040
- Thank you, Mary.
- Oh. 
- The caramel, it's crunchy. They're absolutely wonderful!

679
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,320
No complaints there.

680
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,320
- The caramel is delicious. 
- Spun sugar too!

681
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,720
I think you've done a good job, but, unfortunately,

682
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,080
if you'd baked it and then used only the creme patisserie with the limoncello

683
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,720
you would have had a nicer, more stable croquembouche.

684
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,400
Thank you.

685
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,160
I like the look of it.

686
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,840
- They're great colours in there. I like the nougatine base too.
- Good.

687
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,280
- Some of the caramel has crystallised.
- Yes.

688
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,960
That is because you've stirred it.

689
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,800
I took some from the top and, you know, I might lose my teeth on it.

690
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,000
- Oh, sorry. 
- I think your flavours are great!

691
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,760
- Mmm! Delicious!
- The filling is lovely. You've certainly got that orange coming through.

692
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,720
My only issue is the overall appearance of it. A little bit bigger maybe.

693
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,280
Yeah, you're right. No, I intended to make it bigger.

694
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,840
- Oh, did you?
- But I ran out of time.

695
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,240
I think my issues are that you've burnt the sugar

696
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,480
and the profiteroles look quite dark as well.

697
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,640
It's a shame when you overcooked the caramel.

698
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,960
- But it's well constructed and it's held up.
- It is constructed extremely well. It's a shame.

699
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,000
- The flavour of the rose is coming through, but it's been ruined by the caramel.
- Right.

700
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,360
- It's the bitterness is... is hanging on the tongue and that's down to the sugar.
- Yeah.

701
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,560
Close up it looks lovely.

702
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,160
It doesn't look so good from a distance.

703
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,880
Up close I can see some profiteroles, which I was very concerned about,

704
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,000
cos I think you may have overdone it slightly with the chocolate on the outside.

705
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,280
- I added more chocolate to try and make it crack.
- It is very...

706
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,400
- It's very bitter with that chocolate.
- I agree.

707
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
It's not sweet at all.

708
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,200
The actual profiteroles underneath are crisp, dried out and the cream in the middle,

709
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,880
- with that bit of cherry brandy is delicious, but over chocolaty.
- Mmm.

710
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,560
Now, Holly, underneath there is a gingerbread house.

711
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,000
Yes. The idea was I did one layer so you could take it off easily.

712
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,960
- Oh, isn't that... 
- That's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

713
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,400
- I want to live in it.
- That's what an estate agent would call bijoux. 
- It is absolutely sweet.

714
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,200
Mary-Anne, that really has held up well.

715
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,920
I think you've got a nice crisp on the profiteroles as well.

716
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,280
And you've done spun sugar and very well done spun sugar.

717
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,240
Thank you.

718
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,160
- They taste very good.
- Mmm.

719
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,840
Your creme patisserie is absolutely perfect.

720
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,800
The cardamom is just coming through.

721
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,840
- Mmm, it's an after... 
- Mmm.
- It sits on the tongue.

722
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,360
- I'd like to have seen the profiteroles a bit bigger. Just a little.
- I was being dainty!

723
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,920
You're being dainty.

724
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,400
- Thanks very much, Mary-Anne.
- Well, done, Mary-Anne.
- Good effort.

725
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,800
Listen, that was a really tough and exacting challenge.

726
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,600
Please go and have a cup of tea.

727
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,560
Obviously, Paul and Mary are going to retire to consider their verdict

728
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,280
and to decide who is going to progress.

729
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,480
They loved the flavours, but obviously, you know, it collapsed!

730
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,880
So, I am really, really, really disappointed in myself.

731
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,880
You know, I would have liked them to like it, and I just don't feel that they did really.

732
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,480
Today has not gone very well for various reasons, so, yeah, I think I'm going home!

733
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,760
On balance, over the three challenges, Paul, who would you put in the frame to be Star Baker?

734
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,480
Up until today I would have said Jo instantly if this had sort of stood up proudly.

735
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,800
But the interesting one and the best for me was Mary-Anne,

736
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,440
because she had a little bit of cardamom in it

737
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,000
and she had a very interesting creme patissiere

738
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,040
that she'd bothered to add that extra orange and so forth.

739
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,240
We shall leave that dilemma with you two.

740
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,360
Who do you think we might be saying goodbye to?

741
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,080
At this stage it's extremely tricky over the three challenges,

742
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,880
where you get one's good in another and weak in another. It was a really bad week for Holly.

743
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,760
She was at the bottom on two. But Yasmin had an equally pretty bad couple of challenges.

744
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,960
When you look at Yasmin's profiterole, it's overcooked

745
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,280
and the bitterness coming from that sugar is breathtakingly bad.

746
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,920
Holly has really disappointed me. I mean, she has great technique.

747
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,480
She could tackle anything, she's an experienced cook, she's shown us

748
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,160
all the way through, and then she goes boom down this week.

749
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,920
I think we have to look back retrospectively regarding Holly and Yasmin,

750
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,600
because at this stage it is really difficult to pick between them.

751
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,080
I think what we'll both look at now is the technical challenges since the very beginning.

752
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,040
That gives us the level playing field we need to be able to

753
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,760
make that decision who is going to leave us today.

754
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,960
The remaining five bakers have competed for six gruelling weeks.

755
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,720
For one of them, their dream of winning the Great British Bake Off will soon be over.

756
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,640
Let's start on a positive note, and the question, of course, of this week's Star Baker.

757
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:12,240
Now, I think it's fair to say that, before today, there was no question in Paul and Mary's minds

758
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,000
that the Star Baker accolade should be given to Jo.

759
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,920
But with the sad demise, shall we say, the little collapse that went on with the croquembouche,

760
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,720
they had to go back to the drawing board and rethink.

761
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,840
However, because of the sublimeness of your flavours

762
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,680
and the outstanding deliciousness of the whole croquembouche experience,

763
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,040
and I can say because I had a lot of it myself...

764
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:45,320
- And I had the other half. 
- ..it's coming right back at you, Jo. You're Star Baker.
- Well done, you!

765
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,280
Brilliant work.

766
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,400
And now for the harder and sharper end of the spectrum.

767
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:57,000
This week was a very tough call. It was the closest call we have ever had.

768
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
In fact, two people were so sharply in contention that Paul and Mary have had to go back

769
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,840
and look at the results of all of the technical bakes this series. That is how tight it was.

770
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:15,560
And so, after reviewing all that, the person that very sadly will be leaving us...

771
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,600
..is Yasmin.

772
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,600
The rest of you, congratulations, you are semi-finalists. Well done.

773
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,120
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be sorry. I'm relieved.
- Really?
- I'm relieved.

774
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,320
'I'm going because my baking's not up to scratch, obviously. I've had a fair innings'

775
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,840
and I'm pleased with how far I got.

776
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,080
You did brilliantly!

777
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
You made the quarter final!

778
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,200
That's a massive achievement. Well done.

779
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,640
- Oh, Janet.
- Poor little sweetheart.

780
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,840
I feel terrible.

781
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,920
You live and learn. I'm really lucky to be there next week, really lucky.

782
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,440
I feel like I owe it to Yasmin to do well.

783
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,760
I feel like, you know, that's my, my job now is to kind of do us both proud, so...

784
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,480
It became very obvious that Holly was stronger in the Technical Challenges than Yasmin,

785
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,160
therefore Yasmin had to leave.

786
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,360
It was a shame, but it was the only fair way we could look at it.

787
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,040
Chuffed still to be here. I mean, I've loved doing all the challenges, so go me!

788
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,640
I'm just amazed that I'll be in the semi-final, you know?

789
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,400
I don't think I've been in the semi-final of anything in my life before!

790
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,440
To get Star Baker and to be in the final four is like, yes!

791
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,160
Yeah, yeah, it's really good.

792
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,120
Next time, it's the semi-final.

793
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,560
Definitely feel the pressure more, now there's only four of us left.

794
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,000
Having gone through this, it'd be a shame to go out now.

795
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,200
And the bakers must showcase their patisserie skills to perfect some famed pastries and cakes.

796
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Could all go wrong at any point really.

797
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,080
Making their signature mousse cakes.

798
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,320
I don't know what has gone on there!

799
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,520
Paul sets his final technique challenge - iced fingers.

800
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,280
What's in a few grams? But they will make a difference.

801
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,560
I just know he's going to have his eagle eye.

802
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,040
And it's the most demanding showstopper yet -

803
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,240
12 intricate croissant and Danish pastries.

804
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,160
I could look at the fillings and go, "No. I don't like that. Don't like that. Don't like that."

805
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,520
- But who will fail at the last hurdle?
- I can't believe I did that.

806
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,360
And who will make it to the grand final of the Great British Bake Off?

807
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,000
