1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,240
We've been baking for seven weeks now, 

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,960
in our search to find Britain's finest amateur baker. 

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,360
Our handpicked 12 have beaten, whisked, folded and, frankly, often wept, 

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,400
and now we're down to our final three. 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,320
Will they rise under the heat of the judges' criticism, 

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,640
or wilt like eggless sponges? 

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, it's all to play for and they will have to be at their very best if they want to emerge victorious. 

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,120
It's the last week of the bake off and finalists Holly, Jo and Mary-Anne 

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,520
face the three most gruelling challenges yet. 

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Pinch me, because I'm at the final! 

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,600
I'd be kidding myself if I didn't say that I really do want to win. 

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
There's no more next week. This is it. 

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
At the end of these two days... 

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,400
This is where it all goes wrong. 

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,760
..one of these bakers... 

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,560
Oh, good God! 

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,880
I think nerves are a really, really big issue. 

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,520
..Will be crowned the Great British Bake Off Champion 2011. 

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,320
This actually has no flavour. 

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,960
It's a classic! One of the best I've tasted. 

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,920
In the final, you've managed to crack it. 

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
Everything they've baked will be served up 

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,800
in a special street party where the winner will be revealed. 

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,360
And I am beyond measure delighted to announce 

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
that the winner is... 

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Over the last seven weeks, the bakers have taken on everything 

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,600
from biscuits, tarts, pies and pastries to cakes. 

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Only the best three have made it through to the final. 

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,280
Jo's impressed the judges with her fantastic flavours 

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,640
and consistency over the weeks. 

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
- Nice flavours.
- Lovely thin pastry there.
- Sublime. 

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,480
To be the finalist of the Great British Bake Off is a real big feat. 

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,480
It'd be like having all your Christmases and birthdays in one, 

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,560
to win this. It would be really amazing. 

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Holly has proved to be a master of meticulous presentation. 

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,320
Thanks to her constant practise, she's scored highly most weeks. 

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,400
I think they look stunning. 

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,600
It's delicious, absolutely delicious. 

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,080
Thank you. 

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
Every week I've wanted to go to the next week - it's a competition, 

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
you wouldn't do it unless you wanted to keep going, 

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,000
and I'm in the finals, so I am happy! 

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Mary-Anne has earned her place in the final with her technical knowledge 

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,480
and constant desire to experiment. 

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,240
- I adore the way it looks.
- Thank you. 
- It tastes absolutely divine. 

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,040
I want me to win! 

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,240
We'll have none of this sort of shy, retiring wallflower - 

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,360
it's the final, there's no point being here unless you want to win. 

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,480
Good morning, bakers, 

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,800
and a hearty welcome to the final of The Great British Bake Off. 

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
To be crowned champion, 

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,160
you are going to need to bake like you have never baked before. 

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,320
You're going to start off, of course, with your signature bake, 

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,040
and we're asking you today, please, to make 12 millefeuille. 

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,680
Each slice should contain three layers of pastry, 

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,160
and two of filling. 

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Now, you can fill it with a flavouring of your choice, 

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,240
and you can also decorate it in any manner you see fit. 

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,280
Go mad, freestyle, but remember it's the final, 

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,360
so nothing too off-piste. 

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,840
OK, you've got 2.5 hours. 

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,800
- On your marks, get set...
- Bake! 

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,800
This is the bake off final, these people are the cream of the crop. 

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
We expect them to rise to the occasion. 

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
It's all about pushing the boundaries. 

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Now we've got to see absolute perfection. 

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,520
They've really got to prove themselves, 

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,480
and I'm afraid we're going to be very, very tough. 

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,600
A millefeuille is a tower of three pastry layers sandwiched with cream. 

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,520
It can be made with either rough puff or flaky pastry. 

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,600
Mary-Anne and Jo are working with rough puff, 

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,800
where small chunks of butter are added to the mixture. 

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
I haven't impressed with pastry in the competition so far, 

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,520
and I haven't made rough puff pastry since I was at school. 

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
Holly is making flaky pastry 

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,840
by delicately dotting small pieces of butter onto her rolled-out dough. 

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,720
I'm doing a real shortcut which doesn't involve 

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
anywhere near as much resting as you probably should do, 

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,640
but, you know, we don't have the time. 

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,520
So, it's rough puff? 

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,800
Rough puff. 

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,960
For her signature bake, Jo has spent weeks 

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,040
perfecting a raspberry and blueberry millefeuille 

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,960
with an orange zest-infused cream filling. 

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,400
Visually, it's got to look good. 

86
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,280
- You know me, I like my pretty colours.
- You've thought about this. 

87
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,720
It's the final, so I think you're pushing the boat out. 

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,240
At home, you do a new recipe and you don't think anything of it, 

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
- but here, your nerves kick in a little bit.
- How many times have you made it at home, Jo? 

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,000
- Not more than ten, but quite a few times. 
- She sleeps by the oven! 

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,360
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- She does, she curls up, sleeps by the oven. 

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,400
I got married when I was 17, then we had our three sons. 

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,960
And then, literally, I've been a mum and a wife since then. 

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
Then the bake off came along, 

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,640
and it's the first thing that I've ever done totally for me. 

96
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,360
She's never really been able to shine. 

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
She's never been able to do something for herself - she's always just been our mum. 

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
She's always been there, cooked our dinners. 

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,920
- You've had a bacon sandwich already. 
- Now she's showing what she can do. 

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,240
- So, what have you got to do in the final?
- That cream slice, 

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,960
they're called millefeuille, or something, and I've got to do those. 

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,280
She's a lot more confident than she was when she first started, 

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,160
and she'll tell herself she can win. 

104
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,440
I rate the achievement of being in the final to be a massive, 

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
massive thing in my life. 

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,000
Obviously, my most proudest achievement is my three boys, 

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
but it is fantastic. 

108
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
Jo's going for the raspberry coulis. 

109
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Some lovely flavours there, you seem to be quite pleased with those. 

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Basic flavours, but we're looking for the big three - 

111
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,560
presentation, flavour, and then a good lamination in that puff itself. 

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,040
All of them, they are very limited for time. 

113
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,240
We've rushed them. 

114
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,160
After all, this is the final. 

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Getting those crisp layers visible on the outside 

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,320
is the main thing to go for, 

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,160
so that's what we're going for. 

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
Mary-Anne is filling hers with a ginger cream rippled with homemade lemon curd, 

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
and topping them with traditional icing. 

120
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm going to puree some of the stem ginger 

121
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,280
and fold that through. 

122
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Then I'll make a lemon curd and fold that through, so it's like a ripple. 

123
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
And on the top you're going to do feathering? 

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm going to melt some fondant, and then do lines of yellow icing, 

125
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,480
and then with a toothpick, just feather it, 

126
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
so it has a nice pattern. 

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
- Nice and subtle.
- Yes. 

128
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
You make me very happy, Mary-Anne! 

129
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,640
Mary Anne regularly bakes with her daughter. 

130
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,800
The bake off has given her the chance to showcase her knowledge 

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,240
and expand her already massive repertoire. 

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,440
When I told people I'd actually got through to the final 

133
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,880
they were really supportive and said, "We knew you could do it." 

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
I've got cards and messages. 

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
My husband's really pleased for me as he knows it means a lot to me. 

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,200
It sounds corny, but just being in the final is really good, 

137
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,400
and if anything else comes of that, it'll just be the cherry on the top. 

138
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,280
Mary-Anne's competitive with herself as much as with anybody else, 

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,360
so on a scale of one to ten she'd be an 11. 

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,120
To get to the final, and to win it, 

141
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,400
she would feel really proud of herself, and I feel really proud for her as well. 

142
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,520
My daughter knows I'm in a competition 

143
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
and she's been saying that she misses me. 

144
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,600
I've told her that it all comes down to this weekend. 

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,400
My dream scenario would be to finish in half the time and sit on my chair with a cup of coffee, 

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
watching the other two flap around. 

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I don't think that's going to happen but you never know! 

148
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,000
Mary-Anne, she's making the lemon and ginger millefeuille. 

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,560
We know that some of her things have turned out on the rustic side. 

150
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,360
She's promised to go dainty again, so that's a good thing. 

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,680
It's not a lot of time to make 12 millefeuille, so I'm worried, 

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,400
but I'm not as worried as I was on Friday 

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,280
when I had a meltdown in my kitchen, and ended up crying. 

154
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,640
Holly's millefeuille is layers of flaky pastry 

155
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,800
sandwiched with fresh cream, caramel, and her special ingredient. 

156
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,680
Quite different. I've never heard of banana liqueur, have you? 

157
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,760
- Have you heard of it? 
- Yeah, I have. 

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,520
- Quite hard to get hold of.
- Yes. 

159
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,480
I've had it in Florence Station in Italy. Yes, it was a long night. 

160
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,680
- European!
- Yeah. 

161
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,240
I notice that you've put vinegar into your pastry. 

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,640
I sometimes use lemon juice, but not vinegar, because of the flavour. 

163
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,240
I don't think you get it through. Because of the volume of pastry, 

164
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,800
it's two teaspoons in there - it's not a lot. 

165
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,640
- I've got used to doing it. 
- It's for the breakdown - 

166
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,160
to get the crumb - it starts to break down the gluten in the flour 

167
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,400
- because it's an acid.
- Oh, OK. 
- That's the only reason behind it. 

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,960
- Don't have a breakdown, though. 
- I won't. 

169
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,160
Holly manages to juggle caring for her two young boys 

170
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,720
with hours of obsessive baking practise. 

171
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,320
Practise makes perfect. I've never been able to wing it at anything. 

172
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
Holly doesn't do things by halves. 

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,640
She fully committed to the bake off when she entered. 

174
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah, she has been practising an awful lot. 

175
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,520
She does her homework, she'll read the books, 

176
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,640
I know that she's read Mary's bible. 

177
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
Holly will keep doing something until she gets it right, 

178
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
even if it means she doesn't get any sleep. 

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,400
She'll just keep going - she's like the Duracell bunny. 

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,040
'It's about creativity and about perfectionism, you know.' 

181
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,680
It's just got to look so appetising, 

182
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,320
and I think this is really precise stuff. 

183
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm actually more frightened than people think. 

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,400
So Mary, Holly's millefeuille? 

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,840
Yes, Holly has added vinegar to her pastry. 

186
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Now we had a problem when Mary-Anne added it into the pastry, 

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,080
- she was a bit heavy-handed, we could taste it in the final result.
- Yes. 

188
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,360
- We'll wait and see, won't we? 
- There's no room for error at this stage. 

189
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm a little bit stressed to be truthful. 

190
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,520
The oven's cut off! 

191
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, good God! 

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,800
OK, we're halfway through. Halfway through. 

193
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Why is my hand shaking? 

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,960
No, I'm going to have to do those again now. 

195
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,800
I was too busy watching something else and I burnt my hazelnuts 

196
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,120
cos I've got so many things on the go that I sort of, 

197
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,760
you've only got to not watch something for a minute and then it goes! 

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,440
Time's a real problem today. It's a nightmare, 

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
this is not something you try and attempt as an amateur. 

200
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm sure a professional could, 

201
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,840
but we're not professionals. 

202
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,280
These are still a bit warm for icing. I'm dithering. 

203
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,440
Just five minutes in the freezer, I think, 

204
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,360
cos I don't want to... 

205
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,440
Argh do...can't, can't decide! 

206
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm not happy with how they look 

207
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,760
so I'm going to do a praline, 

208
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,000
blend it up to put over the top cos I think it'll look much nicer, 

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,400
but obviously I'm never really made praline before. 

210
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,880
Praline is a combination of nuts and caramelised sugar that is then crumbled or ground 

211
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
to make a crunchy topping, 

212
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,760
making the caramel is not as straightforward as it seems. 

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,160
I think that's the way to do it. 

214
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,200
I've never made it before. 

215
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
To prevent caramel from crystallising it must not be stirred. 

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
Oh, plonker! 

217
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
There's so much going on all at once 

218
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,200
and it's a real big juggling act, this is. 

219
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,240
Yeah it's quite difficult to keep everything going. 

220
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,000
It's going to be really heavy going for this hour. 

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
I think nerves are a really, really big issue. 

222
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,760
The most difficult part is getting the pastry right, 

223
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,840
because this is the decoration. Yes, it needs to look pretty, 

224
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,400
but if the pastry's not right it'll taste awful. 

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,560
Too dark. 

226
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm going to save some nuts and I'm going to do it again, just in case, 

227
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,160
because I don't actually know if that's too burnt or not. 

228
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,480
There's a new caramel being made every 30 seconds. 

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Yeah, my nerves are very, very fraught. 

230
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,920
That's half an hour left, bakers, 

231
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,280
just half an hour remaining, thank you. 

232
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,240
No, it's all going! 

233
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,520
It's 15 minutes remaining on this challenge, bakers. 

234
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,960
No way! 

235
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,760
It's obviously all about balance and, you know, they're so delicate 

236
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,320
that you have to be really careful as you're piping in because, 

237
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,880
yeah, it's really, it's going to be quite tricky, I think. 

238
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,520
Three minutes remaining, bakers. Three minutes on this challenge. 

239
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,400
Oh, raspberries. 

240
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,160
OK, that's time up for the most multi-layered, 

241
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,200
this millefeuille of stress is over. 

242
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,720
So, cakes to the end of the benches, please. 

243
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,400
Considering the time I literally didn't think I was going to get them all done, 

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,440
so, yeah, I'm pleased with how they look. 

245
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,840
The great piping disaster of 2011. 

246
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,400
Its got the yellow decoration but no feathering, 

247
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,120
so I was a bit disappointed. 

248
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm quite pleased I got them finished in the time, 

249
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,160
I had one minute to spare. 

250
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,440
At least I finished them, and they look OK. 

251
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,480
Never has pastry been so scrutinised. 

252
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,480
It's quite tough puff pastry. 

253
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,520
I can't taste the vinegar, I was looking for it. 

254
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,960
You know, we've got to seek perfection here. 

255
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,280
No, I know. 

256
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,320
It's quite tough. 

257
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,560
- Right.
- Normally with a knife you'd go through it, it'll crack. 

258
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,600
Yeah, right. 

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,760
- What you've done is essentially kneaded the puff...
- Right. 
- It's built up the gluten. 

260
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,640
You could have overdone it, but the flavours are lovely. 

261
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,560
I really like the flavours, the neatness, the bake's good. 

262
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,040
I think the ratio of filling and pastry is not quite right. 

263
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,080
I think the pastry should have been rolled out more thinly, 

264
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,880
but the whole finish is absolutely beautiful, it tastes wonderful. 

265
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,280
Well done, Holly. 

266
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,880
Thank you. 

267
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,640
They look sort of friendly and homely. 

268
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Ended up having to make a praline 

269
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,400
which I've never actually made before, 

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,160
so I sort of, was a bit rushed doing that. 

271
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,280
They taste really, really good and your pastry, 

272
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,240
I love the buttery flavour coming through. 

273
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
It would be not nearly as nice without the praline, would it? 

274
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,960
No, excellent mistake! 

275
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,840
It crumbles, actually, and it cracks which is nice. 

276
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,560
Take more care on your piping with the cream. 

277
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,520
Appearance-wise, it does need some work. 

278
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,760
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

279
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
Bit of a problem with the bake on some of these? 

280
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,920
- I think they could have done with a couple of minutes more.
- Yeah. 

281
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,080
There. It's just not baked long enough. 

282
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,520
Now you've done feathering on the top? 

283
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,320
I tried to, we had a bit of a disaster, the piping bag burst. 

284
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,400
- It was pure bad luck that, wasn't it, Mary-Anne?
- Yeah. 

285
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
I like the filling a lot. 

286
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
Good. 

287
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,800
Why do I like it? 

288
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
It is on the sharp side, 

289
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,360
but cos the fondant is very sweet on the top, very sweet, 

290
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,080
and there's an awful lot of it, the two complement each other deliciously. 

291
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
I don't like the filling. 

292
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Oh. 

293
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
For me it's too bitter. 

294
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,320
For a millefeuille it should be, for me, sweeter and creamier. 

295
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,880
The pastry is under-baked and that spoils it for me. 

296
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,040
Yeah. 

297
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,320
That's the way things go. 

298
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
I mean I can't, I don't want to dwell on it 

299
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,480
because I don't want it to affect how I do in the technical bake, 

300
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,080
so I appreciate that there are lessons learnt, 

301
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,440
should have maybe had the oven higher, 

302
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,880
but can't go back, so onward and upward. 

303
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
The judges are scrutinising them a lot more than at the start, 

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,440
they're literally getting down at eye level, checking everything, and so they should do, 

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,240
at this stage they kind of want to get it right. 

306
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,960
I feel quite positive going into the next round. 

307
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,400
I don't think I had too much of a bad round really, 

308
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
considering, you know, I really was under pressure with the praline. 

309
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,080
I feel happy and I'm excited about the next challenge cos I actually quite like the technical bakes. 

310
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
I like a surprise. 

311
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
The time has come for the bakers 

312
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,200
to take on their final technical challenge. 

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,920
With everything to play for, their performance will be critical 

314
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,280
if they want to stand a chance of being crowned bake off champion. 

315
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
OK, ladies, 

316
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
it's time to take cover now, 

317
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,240
it is the much-feared surprise technical challenge. 

318
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,280
As you all know by now this is judged blind, 

319
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,840
so Mary and Paul, please vacate the tent area. 

320
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,400
Off they go. 

321
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,480
So our technical challenge today is our hardest yet. 

322
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,840
Of course, it's the final. 

323
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,040
It is the sachertorte. 

324
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,160
Now this Austrian speciality is no mean feat. 

325
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,400
You've got a really dense torte on top, 

326
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,440
you need to get a nice, shiny slick of chocolate ganache, 

327
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,080
and also, if that wasn't hard enough, 

328
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,560
the recipe details we've given you are deliberate sparse and basic. 

329
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
They're also in Austrian. 

330
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,240
- Yeah.
- No they're not! 

331
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,240
You've got two hours and 40 minutes to complete this challenge, ladies. 

332
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,400
We know you're up to the task, all that remains to say is... 

333
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,520
on your marks, 

334
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,080
- get set...
- Bake! 

335
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,360
I don't know what I'm doing, so it's not very good in the final is it really? 

336
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,320
It'll be quite a hard challenge and I haven't actually made one of these before, 

337
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,160
but I've made ganache and I have made a torte before, 

338
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
so we'll see how it goes. 

339
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,560
I haven't made a sachertorte before, but I've seen a picture, 

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
how hard could it be? 

341
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
So Paul, this is the sachertorte. 

342
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,360
I think it's a great technical challenge. Yeah. 

343
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,320
They've been given the ingredients from start to finish, 

344
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,880
but not what to do with them. 

345
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,680
Baking-wise we've given them no instructions, 

346
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,760
not even how to line the tin or whatever, 

347
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,000
we presented them with a tin so they have to line that carefully, 

348
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
and we've given them a rough baking time. 

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,320
The first challenge is to melt the chocolate correctly. 

350
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,000
I usually melt chocolate in the microwave because 

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,920
over water is slower. 

352
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,880
To be honest I don't really know if there's a perfect way of doing it, but I do know 

353
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,800
one - it has to be melted, and two - never add really, really super hot chocolate 

354
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,200
to creamed butter and sugar, because if you do it melts the butter. 

355
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,480
Made the mistake of walking away, 

356
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,520
and so have to start again now, 

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,400
but I've got a stopwatch 

358
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,600
so I'm going to be checking it every 30 seconds this time, so... 

359
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,640
hopefully we won't have a repeat of that. 

360
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,400
The next stage is to combine the egg yolks with the chocolate. 

361
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
I always try and add eggs in bit by bit otherwise it can curdle, 

362
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,320
but, you know, I don't know if it's right or not, 

363
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,360
but this is the way I'd do it at home, so... 

364
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Next the bakers whisk and mix the egg whites. 

365
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,680
The trick is to keep them moist and flexible, so that along with the trapped air 

366
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,280
they can help the cake to rise whilst keeping it light in texture. 

367
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,240
The whole trick with this is to obviously get a really good, 

368
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
see that's a really good stiff beat but if you over-whisk this, 

369
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,760
it always says in the books it looks dry. 

370
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
What they should do 

371
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,520
is put about a third of the whisked egg whites in 

372
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,200
and stir that in. 

373
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm just going to stir these in rather vigorously 

374
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,080
to loosen the mixture up. 

375
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,760
If they don't do it gently, they'll be losing volume all the time. 

376
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Well, you just have to do these cutting motions, 

377
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
you don't want to lose the air. 

378
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,360
I was going to say the only rising agent is the egg whites itself, 

379
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,040
so they really do have to be careful folding in that last bit of egg white. 

380
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,200
And they've got to do it until it's all one pale chocolate colour, 

381
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,040
and if there are any flecks of egg white when we come to judge it, 

382
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,800
we'll see those and it will give a rather rough finish. 

383
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,040
It has to have a really flat top because you've obviously got to ice it 

384
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,160
then write on it, so you don't want peaks. 

385
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,920
That's about as flat as I can get it so that's going to go in now. 

386
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm just checking I put the flour in! I have! 

387
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,320
There is just an hour left on the clock. 

388
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm going to go with that. 

389
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,120
It's a bit cracked but some tortes have a bit of cracking on the top. 

390
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
Oh, good God! 

391
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,280
It's sunk a tiny bit since it came out of the oven, 

392
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,720
which means it won't have a completely flat top. 

393
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,880
The ganache presumably is there to hide the multitude of ills? 

394
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
That's what I hope. 

395
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,440
The bakers are instructed to use apricot jam 

396
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,880
as a barrier between the cake and the icing, 

397
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,200
which should help achieve a smooth, glossy finish. 

398
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,320
I could use the jam as a way of covering up. 

399
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,640
Breaking up a little bit, so I'm trying to glue it all down. 

400
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,760
Next is the tricky topping... the ganache. 

401
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,280
Now this is a fairly key stage, isn't it? 

402
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,120
It is, this is where it all goes wrong. 

403
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
You're meant to heat the cream 

404
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,040
and then melt the chocolate in the cream. 

405
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,720
So... 

406
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,560
that's how it should work. 

407
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Famous last words! 

408
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,760
Ganache is a glaze made of chocolate and cream. 

409
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,520
It should have a silky-like texture, so that when poured on to the cake 

410
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
it forms a perfectly flat and uniform layer. 

411
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
See, this is the problem with my cake, is that 

412
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
it has a little dip in the middle so we get a big pool of ganache. 

413
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,320
As an eater I don't think that's a problem, 

414
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,200
I think that's great, you get a massive bite of chocolate. 

415
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm happy with that but I think Mary would say, "You've messed with my recipe." 

416
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,880
The traditional finish to a sachertorte 

417
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,000
is the perfect icing of the word "sacher", 

418
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
piped in milk chocolate on the top. 

419
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,720
I'm feeling positively nauseous. 

420
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,880
All you need to do is write six letters on a piece of the cake. 

421
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,920
Yes. 

422
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
You can do it. 

423
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes. 

424
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,800
What you don't want is have a moment where you misspell. 

425
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,920
Yeah. My daughter's called Sasha. 

426
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,480
Well, you could misspell it 

427
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,240
and you could say that it's an ode, 

428
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,600
it's an ode to your daughter. 

429
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,280
Bakers, you've got 15 minutes left. 

430
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,160
Oh, that is lovely. 

431
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh, God, look at that! 

432
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,200
I think it's one of those things where you just do it. 

433
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,360
You just have to do it. 

434
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm going to stand back and let you go for it. 

435
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,000
GASPS 

436
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You, you... 

437
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,000
That's not... 

438
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
That's your fault! 

439
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
But it's no my fault! That's what you're feeling. 

440
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll do a swirl underneath, they'll never notice. 

441
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
Do you know what? 

442
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,280
I think that's beautiful, you just leave it as it is. 

443
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,440
Good for you. 

444
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,320
Ladies, you've got three minutes, three minutes. 

445
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,200
Right... 

446
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,120
Oh, I'm so rubbish at writing. 

447
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
That's it. 

448
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,080
Done. 

449
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,360
Not great, child-like 

450
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,760
but my handwriting is rubbish! 

451
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,040
Well done, ladies. 

452
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,960
The last technical challenge of the bake off is over. 

453
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,000
It's time to bring out Paul and Mary so that the judging can commence. 

454
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,920
As usual for the technical bake 

455
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Mary and Paul don't know whose cake is whose. 

456
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,480
I think we have a problem with the spelling on that one, don't we? 

457
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,800
- It's written in Austrian.
- Oh, right. 
- Oh, well that explains all. 

458
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,160
Old-fashioned Austrian. 

459
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,880
- Shall we start from this side? 
- Yeah. 

460
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,400
The ganache could have been a bit thick but it has the right consistency, 

461
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,600
and that cake looks pretty well done as well, doesn't it? 

462
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,040
The cake looks very good. 

463
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,080
Mmm... 

464
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,200
Getting the apricot through, which is good. 

465
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,920
I think it's a nice cake, that one. 

466
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,360
- It's a nice cake, a little over-decorated.
- Yeah, it is. 

467
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
Now this one, its got the nice ganache on this one. 

468
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,280
Know what? I think that could have done with a bit longer bake. 

469
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,160
There's a little mound at the very bottom here that isn't quite baked. 

470
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,320
It's got more of a high mirror finish which is what you're looking for a sacher, 

471
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,760
but there are bits of egg white floating through the mixture 

472
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,000
and that's because it wasn't mixed in properly in the bowl. 

473
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,320
That dips there, see? 

474
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,840
There's a little ridge round the outside. 

475
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,160
These two could both have done with just a little more, 

476
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,200
five more minutes. 

477
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,120
Well, we've had a jolly good taste and a jolly good look, 

478
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,000
and in third place it's this one here. 

479
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,440
Some of the egg white isn't mixed in really well, 

480
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,560
it has a lovely shiny finish, 

481
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
but it dips 

482
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,040
and we've got a ridge round here, 

483
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,800
but a lovely shiny icing. 

484
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,280
In second place is this one. 

485
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,120
Holly. 

486
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,480
Overall it was a nice cake, 

487
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,960
the dip was the problem with that one, but well done. 

488
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,480
So obviously guess who's number one! 

489
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,520
Well done. The cake of this one was the best. 

490
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,560
A little over-decorated 

491
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,720
but we're in for the taste 

492
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,520
and that's why you came first. 

493
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Basically everyone's bakes were good but mine 

494
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,080
was obviously slightly better, 

495
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,480
so, yeah, it was excellent. 

496
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,040
I thought mine looked OK, and I thought the handwriting looked OK, 

497
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,120
so that was like where I think I excelled, not with the cake though! 

498
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
I am really pleased for Jo 

499
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,000
because she doesn't understand how good she is as a baker, 

500
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,960
and it's nice for her to get recognition. 

501
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I still think anyone could win it. 

502
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,960
It's the final day in this year's search for Britain's best amateur baker. 

503
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,800
Today is the finale and they've got to do their very best 

504
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,680
and they've got to impress us. 

505
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,600
Yesterday Holly impressed with her banoffee-inspired millefeuille, 

506
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,320
and Jo came first in the sachertorte challenge, 

507
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,520
whilst Mary-Anne's bakes were both undercooked. 

508
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,160
I think Holly and Jo are fairly level, 

509
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,920
so it's Mary-Anne that's in the precarious position, 

510
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,640
she really has to make something extremely special. 

511
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,960
You know Mary-Anne is capable of going to great heights, 

512
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,160
technically she is really brilliant. 

513
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,520
This challenge marks the end of many weeks of competitive baking, 

514
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,400
after which their efforts will be served to family and friends 

515
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,440
at the Great British Bake Off street party. 

516
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,280
It's going to become a pressure cooker for four hours, 

517
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,920
and it's the one that really drives for it, and wants to win, will win. 

518
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,200
Today it's up to them. May the very best one win. 

519
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,480
Bakers, good morning, it's grand final day 

520
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
this is your last showstopper challenge, 

521
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
so what we'd like you to do 

522
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,320
is to create a selection of contemporary petits fours. 

523
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Now ladies, the judges would like you please to present 

524
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,120
three types of petit four, the first should include meringue, 

525
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,520
the second sweet pastry, 

526
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
and the third should be sponge-based. 

527
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,560
They're not just looking for technical brilliance, 

528
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,920
they're also looking for a really stunning visual presentation, 

529
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,800
and they've given you a theme as well, 

530
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,360
because it's the grand final, 

531
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,400
which is British summertime. 

532
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,680
And these will all be served at the bake off summer street party 

533
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,320
and, most importantly, after four hours of baking 

534
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,000
one of you will be crowned 2011's Great British Bake Off champion. 

535
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,720
With that in mind, on your marks, 

536
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,400
get set... 

537
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,960
Bake. 

538
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,800
Today they will be judged on their technical ability, 

539
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,160
consistency of their bakes, delicious complementary flavours 

540
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,880
and an original impressive summertime presentation. 

541
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,560
Presentation is the key to this challenge, 

542
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,040
but they must keep to the very best flavours, 

543
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,600
so it's looking good and tasting good. 

544
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
It's a bit worrying being this close, 

545
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
I've been feeling nauseous since yesterday, 

546
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,440
haven't had any breakfast, but I have caffeine so it's not all bad, 

547
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,960
I'll just have to concentrate on what I'm doing, 

548
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,240
and make sure that it's finesse is the watchword and not rustic. 

549
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,760
Obviously the dream scenario would be to win, but you know what? 

550
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,800
If I can do well and produce good things then that would be really good also. 

551
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,320
It is really exciting, really exciting. 

552
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,520
- What are you going to do? 
- I've gone for things 

553
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,960
that mean summer to me, one being Wimbledon, 

554
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,200
and then I'm using the great British seaside as my inspiration, 

555
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,080
because I love going to the seaside. 

556
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,480
Holly is making strawberry and cream mousse meringues, 

557
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,160
gooseberry and elderflower Bakewell tarts 

558
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,360
and a Neapolitan ice cream sponges. 

559
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,680
- Can you cope with all these things, will you be OK for time? 
- There's a lot to do. 

560
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,120
Mmm. 

561
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,680
But I have timed it and I can do it. 

562
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,560
Did you sleep, are you worried today? 

563
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,000
Yesterday I was probably the most relaxed I've ever been, strangely. 

564
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,920
I thought that would carry on today, but last night in bed my heart was racing. 

565
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,080
I was thinking, "Stop it, why are you doing this to yourself?" 

566
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,160
But you can't control your body, can you? 

567
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,360
Obviously the nerves are there but I've tried to keep them down. 

568
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,320
I'm just making my Victoria sandwich mixture, just an all-in-one method. 

569
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Jo is making mini Victoria sandwiches, 

570
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,120
white chocolate and raspberry pistachio meringues 

571
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,760
and mini banoffee pies. 

572
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,440
I like the idea of this, I mean, it is a very British dish, the Victoria sponge certainly. 

573
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,120
About three hours from potentially being crowned the winner 

574
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,680
of this competition, how do you feel about that, 

575
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,120
how does the prospect of winning feel? 

576
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,080
Really, really unbelievable. 

577
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,480
I can't even think that far, it makes me really nervous, 

578
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,200
so I need to just focus on this and block that out. 

579
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,480
If you think about it you might go into giggly Jo and giggly Jo might... 

580
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,880
- Heart attack not-breathing Jo! 
- Don't want that! 

581
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,040
After my piping disasters yesterday, I'm showing no fear 

582
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,080
and I'm doing piping in everything today, 

583
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,120
just, I'm even going to pipe pastry, pipe fruit, pipe everything! 

584
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,240
Mary-Anne is making summer fruit tarts, 

585
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,160
strawberry and rhubarb cheesecakes 

586
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,800
and blackcurrant meringues filled with everlasting syllabub. 

587
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,080
This sounds spectacular, it really does. 

588
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,680
Some flavours which are fantastic, I'd like to see how the elderflower works as well. 

589
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
- You could win. 
- I could.
- How do you feel? 

590
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,160
Apprehensive, 

591
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm scared of winning, I think. 

592
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,960
- Scared of winning? Why scared of winning?
- I don't know, 

593
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,800
you'll be a winner then and everyone will be looking at you! And I'm so shy. 

594
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,040
- They'll be looking at you anyway! 
- Your name will ring for ever. 

595
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,000
So let's start with Mary-Anne. 

596
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,240
My only issue with Mary-Anne is sometimes 

597
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
the ideas are great, the flavours sound great, 

598
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,280
but she'll just fall at that last hurdle 

599
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,240
when the overall appearance just doesn't hit the mark. 

600
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,880
There's always a sense with her 

601
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,000
they could turn out to be less petit four and more enorme four 

602
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,200
because she does tend to create sort of quite vast spectacles. 

603
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,840
- Yeah.
- Now what excites me about Holly's menu is the, the Napolitano. 

604
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,240
She's got her beautiful little meringue, 

605
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,080
she's got the little pastry, 

606
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,640
but her layered Neapolitan ice cream could be too big. 

607
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,840
Jo is doing a banoffee pie inspired tartlet, 

608
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,800
so she's got the sweet crust, caramel she's glazing on the bottom, then this banana mousse. 

609
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,920
I think that's very, very clever. 

610
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,800
I like the idea of the caramel. 

611
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,360
That banana mousse on the top, 

612
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,640
oh, I'm really looking forward to that one. 

613
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,800
Do you know they started today 

614
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,840
all on an even keel, more or less, 

615
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,000
and so they've got an awful lot to play for, 

616
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
and they could rise or they could drop. 

617
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,920
How's it going? 

618
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
It's going OK. We're all up against it. 

619
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,120
- Yeah.
- The time pressure, the finesse that's required and... 

620
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,560
- Yeah.
- ..the amount of different things you're having to do. 

621
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,640
The bakers put their meringues in the oven first 

622
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,160
as they will need to be cooked for two hours at a very low heat. 

623
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,320
The aim is to slowly evaporate most of the water but not before 

624
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,080
it's dissolved the sugar to leave a crispy, sweet structure. 

625
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,280
Well, it's more drying than cooking, 

626
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,720
and you don't want them to brown at all, 

627
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,400
just want them to dry out. 

628
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
With three hours to go, 

629
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,320
Holly is moving on to rolling out the all-butter vanilla pastry 

630
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,160
for her Bakewell tarts. 

631
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,560
When I first started doing this competition I really, really liked pastry, 

632
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,760
so my theory on pastry was thick was good. 

633
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,800
I now know thick is bad, so... 

634
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,160
I have learnt a lot! 

635
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm just going to try and make sure that the edges are all really tidy 

636
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,520
because the last time we made mini tarts I got marked down 

637
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,960
because my edges weren't particularly tidy. 

638
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,040
I chose them initially cos I thought they're nice and deep, 

639
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,600
you can get some good taste of the creme patissiere inside, 

640
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,080
but now I'm thinking, "Oh, they're deep, they might stick, 

641
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,160
"they might not want to come out," 

642
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,720
so they've got a liberal coating of cooking spray, 

643
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,680
so I'm trying not to press the pastry too hard into the flutes. 

644
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,880
Lady finalists, we are halfway through your last ever show, 

645
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,440
off she goes, show stopper challenge. 

646
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,200
You've had two hours, you've got two hours to go. 

647
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,960
Mary-Anne has a novel method for achieving 

648
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,120
the stripy surround sponge for her mini cheesecakes. 

649
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,240
First she spreads out a sheet of red joconde-decor paste. 

650
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,000
Now we take an adhesive scraper from your local DIY shop... 

651
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,640
This is made from red food colouring, egg whites, 

652
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,760
icing sugar, butter and flour. 

653
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,000
Now I'm going to put this in the freezer so it can freeze up. 

654
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,160
Like a strawberry facial! 

655
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm going to put the cake batter over the top 

656
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,680
and bake that. 

657
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,120
The guests are waiting to try the bakers' petits fours. 

658
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,640
Among them, a few familiar faces. 

659
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,160
For me it would be between 

660
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,360
Mary-Anne and Jo, 

661
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,000
but I think Jo might just tip the scales. 

662
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,960
I think the person to win is Holly. I've had my money on her. 

663
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,400
I'm sure they're all worthy winners. 

664
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,200
I'm basically assembling my Neapolitan ice cream squares. 

665
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,920
Look at that! 

666
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,200
That is like a beautiful hotel luxury mattress. 

667
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,600
Look at that. It's the first pinstripe sponge I've seen. 

668
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,640
You seem very quiet, is that focus? 

669
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,240
- Blind panic, actually.
- You go into yourself when you blind panic? 

670
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,480
Well, normally I'm panicking by myself in the kitchen, but... 

671
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,960
- Yes, on this programme we like to have panic in full view.
- Yes. 

672
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,160
OK, bakers, that's just half an hour remaining before judgement. 

673
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,000
The chocolate is to form a barrier between the sort of creamy syllabub 

674
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,560
and the dry meringue, and hopefully keep the meringue nice and crisp. 

675
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,880
Just, just there, oh, stay. 

676
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,840
Talking to myself again, Sue. 

677
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,040
This has been a consistent feature. 

678
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,120
Yes. 

679
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,640
A lot of chitter chatter. There's a lot of... 

680
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,840
That's what happens when there's boys in the house and men, 

681
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,760
they just tend to ignore you, so I talk to myself and the dog. 

682
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,560
Mary-Anne, Jo, Holly, you've got ten minutes left. 

683
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,360
This is the culmination of eight busy weeks. 

684
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,600
Get the passion out on the plates and await the judges. 

685
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,560
Holly, in order to talk to you I'll have to be fairly mobile, 

686
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,160
cos I've noticed as well as creating these extraordinary petits fours, 

687
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,640
- you've pretty much run a marathon... 
- Yeah.
- ..over the last 20 minutes. 

688
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,680
I think I have. 

689
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,040
I'm just going to have to get the bowl. 

690
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,000
Over here! 

691
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,800
Let's get fit with Holly! 

692
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,360
I can't keep up and I haven't made petits fours. 

693
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,120
Ladies, you've got three minutes for this, your final ever show stopper challenge. 

694
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,640
(Oh, three minutes.) 

695
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,160
OK, bakers, that's it, that's time up, 

696
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,760
your bake off experience is over, you've done everything you can, 

697
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,440
move your stuff to the end of your benches. Well done. 

698
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,240
You all right, Mary-Anne? 

699
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,160
Bomb site! 

700
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,200
That is without question the most full on, intensive, 

701
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,760
non-stop start to finish four hours of my life! 

702
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm pleased I went with what I did, actually. 

703
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,160
I think I've shown enough skill, I've made jam. 

704
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,520
Made a mousse. 

705
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,320
Made Italian meringue butter cream. 

706
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Made brandy snaps. Made a ganache. 

707
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,560
You know, really gone for it. 

708
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,280
I do today believe in my bakes, I really do, actually. 

709
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,960
I feel like I've really produced good stuff today. 

710
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,760
I really hope they don't think I've gone over the top with my cake stand, 

711
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,880
be disappointed if they're too mean! 

712
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,960
So bakers, 

713
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,400
well done. 

714
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,640
You've completed your final show stoppers, 

715
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,960
so it's time for the final judgement. 

716
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,200
Holly, you're up first. 

717
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,120
Holly has made strawberry and cream mousse meringues, 

718
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,240
gooseberry and elderflower Bakewell tarts 

719
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,160
and Neapolitan ice cream sponges. 

720
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,800
That's a nice idea, it is a really nice idea, Holly. 

721
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,680
The meringue is very good. 

722
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,800
It's amazing. 

723
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,760
It's got a nice chewiness to it. You know, that's delicious. 

724
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,440
It melts really well, flavours and textures are good, the size is good. 

725
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,040
Can we just turn that one upside down? 

726
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,600
- Which one, this one?
- That one. 

727
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,920
Yes, beautifully evenly baked. 

728
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,280
That's good, the pastry is beautifully baked. 

729
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,720
Have you got a jam layer? 

730
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,240
I made gooseberry and elderflower jam. 

731
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,960
- And on top of that you've got a frangipane?
- Yes. 

732
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,600
Your frangipane has been lost. 

733
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,120
Has it? 

734
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,920
All you can taste is the jam. 

735
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,600
So that moves us on to the ice cream which is the Neapolitan style sponge. 

736
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,960
It's a nice idea. 

737
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,080
I think it's a nice idea but I think it's really too big, 

738
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,400
and I think that you've shown us lots of skills, 

739
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,200
I love seeing that brandy snap, but it's totally lost, 

740
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,280
you wouldn't recognise it has a brandy snap. 

741
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,880
I find that a little disappointing. 

742
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,240
It's a bit dry. 

743
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,520
- Is it?
- Yeah. 

744
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,960
If they were thinner, same amount of filling, 

745
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,320
same amount of icing, would have been a lot better. 

746
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,520
This actually has no flavour. 

747
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,800
That's my biggest issue I think. 

748
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,680
It's been overwhelmed by the butter cream on the top. 

749
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,800
It's a lovely display, it's very original, you've thought it all out. 

750
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
- Well done, Holly.
- Thank you. 

751
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,680
Well done, Holly. 

752
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,440
Jo has made mini Victoria sandwiches, 

753
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,960
white chocolate and raspberry pistachio meringues 

754
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,200
and mini banoffee pies. 

755
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,520
Jo, what a lovely way to present cakes 

756
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,640
for perhaps summer in the garden. 

757
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,960
Don't those look inviting? 

758
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,680
You're a good girl, you've got them all the right balance. 

759
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,520
They match, don't they? 

760
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,920
They do, because you've got the extra height, 

761
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,760
what you've done is you've shrunk the size, 

762
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,080
so overall the balance is the same. 

763
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,800
Display, absolutely fantastic, 

764
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,640
that would be seen in any five-star hotel in their afternoon tea area for sure. 

765
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,000
Mmm. 

766
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,280
It's a nice light bake, that gentle flavour 

767
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,920
of the fruit, it doesn't kick you in the teeth. 

768
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,080
Vitoria sponge is an absolute classic, 

769
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,120
which is one of the best that I've tasted, 

770
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,840
and it's rather nice to have it that size. 

771
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,240
If I just move on to this meringue. 

772
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,880
That really works, it dances on your tongue. 

773
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,920
Those raspberries, once you break through the meringue 

774
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,160
it hits your tongue, ding a ling a ling, 

775
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,440
and sets off everything. That's amazing. 

776
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,120
The meringue is cooked for the right time. 

777
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,680
It's still got that nice chewiness to it, 

778
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,960
and it's a nice surprise to find 

779
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,480
decent-sized pieces of pistachio in it. 

780
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah. Now the one actually I'm looking forward to is this one, 

781
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,920
which is the banoffee-style tart. 

782
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,000
It's a good bake. 

783
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,280
You needed to work the dough a bit more so it's more stable. 

784
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,320
Oh! 

785
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,680
That's good, that. 

786
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,760
That is superb. 

787
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,520
They're very, very short 

788
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,360
and you would have to serve those a bit chilled. 

789
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,880
It's very, very soft and quite difficult to eat. 

790
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,040
Yeah, I totally agree 

791
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,400
but that's the only criticism of those three. 

792
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,920
- Thank you so much. 
- Well done, Jo.
- Thank you. 

793
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,880
Mary-Anne has made strawberry and rhubarb cheesecakes, 

794
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,120
summer fruit tarts 

795
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,960
and blackcurrant meringues filled with everlasting syllabub. 

796
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, they certainly look "pick your own", 

797
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,320
covered in beautiful English fruits. 

798
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,480
But they look amazing, I love the idea of the fruits on the top of each one. 

799
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,680
Shall we try this one first? 

800
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
- That's delicious.
- Thank you. 

801
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,360
It's not too sweet either. It's creamy and not too sweet. 

802
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,800
It's a perfect home bake. 

803
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,840
Thank you very much. 

804
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,840
It's a bit of a hotel bake. 

805
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,640
Well, do you know, we can do good things at home, 

806
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,520
and then we come to this very nice, beautiful little tart. 

807
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,480
- The pastry is actually rather thick. 
- Yeah. 

808
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,080
Just too much pastry, isn't it? 

809
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,200
- It hasn't worked.
- No. 

810
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
That's a bit of a shame that, actually. 

811
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,680
And the creme patissiere, 

812
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,120
I could have done with a bit more vanilla in it. 

813
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,920
Mmm. Shall we try this one? 

814
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,560
Mary-Anne, I like the way you didn't use food colouring, 

815
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,920
you used freeze-dried blackcurrant powder 

816
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,400
which has given it a lovely colour. 

817
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,600
What's in that syllabub? 

818
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,680
It's a sweet dessert wine and brandy. 

819
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,280
It's too alcoholic. 

820
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,680
You need to burn that off before you use it inside of cream. 

821
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,800
It's destroyed any flavour that you wanted to achieve in that. 

822
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,600
It's a huge disappointment to me. 

823
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,040
I think it's absolutely lovely, 

824
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,400
and the pure alcohol is doing me a lot of good! 

825
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,960
I think that's really lovely. 

826
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,240
I couldn't disagree more strongly with Mary in my life, 

827
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,080
because I think the interior of that is revolting to me. 

828
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,640
I just don't get it at all. 

829
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,600
I'll have a bit more to disagree again. 

830
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Easy Mary, remember what the doctor said! 

831
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,000
But the whole presentation is absolutely stunning. 

832
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,920
- Well done.
- Thank you. 

833
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,080
Thank you, well done. 

834
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,360
As Paul and Mary deliberate, 

835
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,240
our finalists take their bakes to share with past bakers, family and friends 

836
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,560
at the Great British Bake off street party. 

837
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,840
Excuse me, Mr Hollywood, 

838
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,760
"revolting" for a syllabub? 

839
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,960
And he said that you couldn't have that amount of alcohol in it. 

840
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,200
It's a 500-year-old recipe and I don't think a revolting recipe 

841
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,320
would last that long if it was revolting. 

842
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,720
I would hope they're going to look at yesterday 

843
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,600
and also look at every week, you know, 

844
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,200
that would be the right thing to do, but I don't know. 

845
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,000
I just had no nerves at all today, I just, honestly and truly 

846
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,040
thoroughly enjoyed every single moment of it. 

847
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,840
Now it's fair to say we've got three really worthy finalists, but going into this final challenge, 

848
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,360
Mary-Anne needed to do something extraordinary. 

849
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
Everything in the right proportion 

850
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,080
but the flavours weren't quite there. 

851
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,880
And you have said to her pretty much every bake off, 

852
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,360
"make it dainty, make it dainty", and she did. 

853
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,600
She did, she nailed it. 

854
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,920
She came up with the goods. 

855
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,200
- Unfortunately she lacked that finesse to finish it off with the flavour as well.
- Yeah. 

856
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,720
She's a rough diamond. 

857
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,680
She's very good at what she does, 

858
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,920
she just needs honing down and we'd have a fantastic baker. 

859
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,720
Yesterday we were in a situation where both Holly and Jo 

860
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,640
were pretty much neck and neck. 

861
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,600
Yeah, for me, when I look at Holly I see technically the ability, 

862
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,040
she is so precise, for instance, 

863
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,480
you only have to look at that meringue nest to realise she's done the peaks, 

864
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,400
every one of those would be perfect. 

865
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,080
When you look at macaroons, if you remember, she did the lollipops... 

866
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,120
Yeah. 

867
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,760
The lines round the lollipops, 

868
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,080
the display was so good. 

869
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,120
We come to the tart, and that little tart was fine. 

870
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,400
The flavouring of the elderflower and the gooseberries, you know, 

871
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,280
all very summertime which is what we were after, 

872
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,080
but it absolutely drowned 

873
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,640
the flavour of the almonds, 

874
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,360
and it just didn't really work. 

875
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,240
And then we come to Jo who hasn't always been particularly meticulous, 

876
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,760
but what she sometimes lacks in the consistency of the aesthetic 

877
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,920
she makes up for in these big flavours. 

878
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,160
The meringue was great, 

879
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,840
the raspberry inside, the freeze-dried raspberry, 

880
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,320
when you hit that, the dryness of the raspberry in the meringue hasn't hit the moisture yet, 

881
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,440
so as soon as it hits your tongue, bam, bam, bam, bam, 

882
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,760
leaping up and down, beautiful flavours. 

883
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,040
She has been rather simple with her recipes. 

884
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,760
She's not been too elaborate. 

885
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,440
She's a really good home baker 

886
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,600
who has advanced through every single session. 

887
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,040
- Yeah.
- Where she falls down is technically she follows some recipes 

888
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,600
and falls down at the last minute, and that includes profiteroles, 

889
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,360
that includes some cakes she's... 

890
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,760
- It wasn't her recipe, it was the actual structure!
- The tower, yeah! 

891
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,560
Her flavours are always good, 

892
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,000
what she lacks in sometimes is that little bit 

893
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,920
of technical expertise and precision to actually come through with it, 

894
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,120
whereas when you look at Holly she's been technically very good, 

895
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,720
although sometimes she lacks that depth of flavour. 

896
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,960
Yeah. 

897
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,480
So between them you've gotta choose which particular skill you're going to go for. 

898
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,960
I wouldn't want to be you. 

899
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,000
I think very, very little separates them and I think, 

900
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,320
the pair of you need to deliberate and look at the signature bakes, 

901
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,360
the technical bakes, the show stoppers 

902
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,280
and to come up with a worthy champion. 

903
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
It is going to be extremely difficult. 

904
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,000
After a long discussion, and taking into account eight weeks of baking, 

905
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,080
Mary and Paul were in total agreement 

906
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,840
over who should be crowned the Great British Bake Off champion. 

907
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,120
Each of our finalists has beaten thousands of other amateur bakers to be here, 

908
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,640
baked for over 60 hours in the marquee, 

909
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,680
produced hundreds of pastries, biscuits and cakes, 

910
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,400
and now finally one of them will be crowned 

911
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,800
the Great British Bake Off champion. 

912
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,560
Welcome to this, the final 

913
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,760
of the Great British Bake Off 2011, 

914
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,600
and can I start by asking our three lovely finalists 

915
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,120
to take their walk of honour up to their places. 

916
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,200
The finalists! 

917
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,120
Holly, Jo and Mary-Anne. 

918
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,600
Who-hoo! Yay! 

919
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,640
Ladies and gentlemen, family, friends 

920
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,320
and our 12 beloved bakers past and present, 

921
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,720
I'm delighted to say that Paul and Mary have finally 

922
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,600
reached a verdict, 

923
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,600
and I am utterly beyond measure delighted to announce 

924
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,640
that the winner 

925
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,600
of the 2011 Great British Bake Off 

926
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
is... 

927
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Jo! 

928
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,960
I knew it! 

929
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,120
Well done. 

930
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,800
- It couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
- Thank you. 

931
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,360
Jo's an excellent winner. She produces beautiful food, beautiful looking, beautiful tasting, 

932
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,800
and hopefully she will start to get the hint she is a very good baker. 

933
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,280
It's been fun and it's been hard work in equal measures, 

934
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,040
and I'm so glad that I wrote on that application form and that I... 

935
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,280
You know, I so nearly didn't. 

936
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,960
Jo out of everyone 

937
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,160
had the furthest to go, 

938
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,160
her progression in the whole bake off has just been superb, 

939
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,240
and when it came to the final, 

940
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:15,040
the flavour of that banana mousse, it was just unbelievable. 

941
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,400
Technical ability, and the precision, 

942
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,680
and the flavour all thrown in. Fantastic. 

943
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,240
She got better and better and she made the three bakes, 

944
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,440
they all looked so pretty and polished, 

945
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,360
but the most important thing of all, each one tasted absolutely superb. 

946
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,600
She has achieved great heights, the winner, 

947
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,880
I hope she's chuffed to bits. 

948
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,080
Oh! Mmm. I feel really, really emotional at the moment. 

949
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,640
I really, just feel totally overwhelmed. 

950
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,000
Total delight. 

951
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,000
I do feel really proud, really, really proud of myself. 

952
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,440
You did it! 

953
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,040
