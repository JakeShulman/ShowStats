00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,760
The Great British Bake Off this year saw the best amateur bakers in the country battle it out 

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,200
to be crowned Bake Off Champion. 

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,320
Along the way we saw them tackle pastries, cakes, pies, 

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,400
biscuits, patisserie and bread. 

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,120
It's not proved enough and it's not baked enough. 

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,280
But now it's our turn. 

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,680
This time expert judges Mary Berry and I take over the Bake Off tent 

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,520
to do some baking ourselves. 

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,840
Coming up, 

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,600
Mary Berry takes on a traditional British cake, the Battenberg, 

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,360
a complicated layered-sponge construction held together 

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,480
with buttercream and wrapped in perfectly smooth marzipan. 

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,640
Mary's recipe for tarte au citron, the classic French tart, 

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,320
perfect sweet, thin, crisp pastry 

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,160
with a deliciously sharp lemon filling. 

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,520
My take on the traditional Italian flatbread, focaccia, 

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,680
with its tricky wet dough and aerated crumb structure. 

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,840
And finally, Mary's brandy snaps, the seemingly simple treat 

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,800
that requires precision and perfect timing 

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,040
to achieve its signature shape and snap. 

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
We will show you some tips and tricks that will help you to create something magical. 

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,200
From the mixing, to the baking, to the finishing, to the presentation. 

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,080
At home, you will get the same results. 

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Each week the bakers in the great British Bake Off 

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,800
face three challenges set by Mary and I. 

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,640
And the one that always spread fear through the tent 

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
was the technical challenge. 

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,080
It was specifically designed to test the bakers' knowledge, intuition and skill 

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,640
in the context of a classic recipe. 

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
It's delicious, absolutely delicious. 

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
The first round of the competition this year kicked off 

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
with a weekend devoted to cakes. 

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
The technical bake is a controlled test 

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,560
of both your intuition and your ability. 

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,920
What you are going to be creating is the bete noire of bakers. 

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,720
It's a Battenberg cake. Not just any old Battenberg cake 

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
but a coffee and walnut Battenberg cake. 

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,920
So, Mary, you chose Battenberg as the first technical challenge 

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,440
in the Bake Off this year. Why? 

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,320
It's a classic. It's a cake that everybody knows 

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,920
and it has many tricky stages. 

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,880
They had to be able to make basic sponge, 

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,280
but they'd got to do it in two varieties, 

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
they had to cut it, shape it, 

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,760
and you've got to get that chequerboard effect, 

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,560
and that's difficult. 

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,080
Usually it's pink and vanilla. 

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,520
- That's right.
- I thought we could make it a little more sophisticated and have it with walnuts and coffee. 

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,680
- There's lots of pitfalls in this particular recipe.
- Oh, there are! 

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,720
I think none more so in the fact of 

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,520
making sure that the squares are absolutely equal. 

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Cos for me, a Battenberg is all about the size of those squares, 

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,840
the way they're shaped out, and essentially, a Battenberg is square. 

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,200
That's why I chose it. 

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,520
So, where do we start when we're making a Battenberg? 

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Well, we start off by lining the tin. 

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to use a tin that a lot of people will have at home, 

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,520
and that is a square tin, about 7Â½ or 8 inches. 

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Or for sheer luxury, and you really like to make them often, 

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,800
- you can have a tin like this one. 
- Oh, that's not fair is it! 

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,880
No, but if everybody likes them and wants to make them often 

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,000
- these have...
- They're brilliant! These come out?
- Yes.
- And you'll have a neat rectangle of sponge. 

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,800
These all come out and then of course you could use it for flapjacks. 

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,160
- I'm going to show you how you can divide the tin in half.
- OK. 

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Because I want to put my vanilla this side, 

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,440
- and the other side I'm going to put the walnut and coffee.
- Yeah. 

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,880
I need a division and I don't want the two mixtures 

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,040
to run into each other. 

69
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,000
'Before lining your tin, grease it well with some softened butter.' 

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,920
Don't do it with oil because if you do it with oil it would slip. 

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,840
'Take a piece of foil-lined baking parchment, 

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
'which is a little bigger than the tin, 

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
'fold it in the middle to create a divide. 

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
'Then place it in the tin 

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,480
'making sure the divide is at least the height of the tin 

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,960
'and in the centre.' 

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,920
Press it right down into those corners 

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
- and then over the top like that.
- Yes. 

79
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
- So that's ready. Now I need to make the Battenberg.
- OK. 

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
- Now the sponge method you're using for this.
- Mm-hm. 

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,760
All-in-one or creaming the butter and the sugar, adding the eggs? 

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm, because I'm very busy, 

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
and I want a really good result, I'm going to use the all-in-one method. 

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
So you reckon that all-in-one method as a sponge is better than 

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,840
the creaming method with the butter and the sugar? 

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,920
I do, I get a better result from it, and it is far easier. 

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,960
I'll just put a little dusting in there. 

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
You could weigh the 100 grams of self-raising flour in there. 

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,320
- Mm-hm.
- Then put the baking spread on the top. 

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Add the marg on the top. OK. 

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,600
Right. I mean, to make cakes, and this programme's all about baking, 

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,040
it is weighing accurately, 

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,560
so we'll start off by putting 100 grams of self-raising flour in there. 

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,760
That's four ounces, that's right. 

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,400
There you go. 

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,200
And then 100 grams baking spread. So that is exactly 200 in there. 

97
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
That's exactly 100 of each. 

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
- And because you've floured the bowl...
- Yes.
- It slips off easily. 

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,360
- Yes.
- Then we want 50 grams of ground almonds.
- 50 grams of ground almonds. 

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,680
Putting ground almonds in this helps with the keeping quality. 

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,600
- Yeah.
- I don't think it'll keep very long because it's going to be eaten. 

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,360
- Right, so we've got almonds, we need sugar.
- Sugar. 

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,000
- Castor sugar and 100 grams. 
- 100 grams of castor sugar. 

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,560
- That's right.
- OK. 
- And we need baking powder now. 

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,400
You may think using self-raising flour and baking powder... 

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,920
- And baking powder. We've spoken about this before.
- I know. 

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,360
The old-fashioned creaming method you used to beat until it was light and fluffy. 

108
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Because we're just beating it, not a lot, 

109
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,800
I want a little bit extra rise in this 

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,120
- and I'm going to add half a teaspoon just like that.
- Yes. 

111
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,440
- So just a little.
- OK. 

112
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,880
- To make that extra rise.
- OK. 

113
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,400
- Eggs, two, please. 
- Eggs, two, whole? 

114
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,880
- Whole, yes.
- Whole, straight in. 
- No need to separate them this time. 

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,760
I think that's... If I do that, it drips all down the side. 

116
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,320
I bet you can do 100 an hour or... 

117
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
- Two, two, two.
- Two? 
- Many of my mixes take 50 eggs. 

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,840
- Do they?
- So we just stand there, cracking eggs.
- I won't compete. 

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,400
Right, so at that stage, just beat it together. 

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,040
And you only need to mix this until it is smooth, 

121
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,280
and you don't go on and on and on beating it 

122
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,680
when it's the all-in-one method, just when it's all together. 

123
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
I feel like a five-year-old, 

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
standing next to my mum when she's making a cake. 

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,240
That's all right. I'll let you lick the bowl, then. 

126
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm going to divide that in half because I want one vanilla half. 

127
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,600
Yes. 

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,760
- And one...
- Walnut and coffee. 

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,040
- Exactly, that's it.
- OK. 

130
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,560
'To finish this sophisticated Battenberg mix, 

131
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,920
'add one-and-a-half teaspoonfuls of milk 

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,240
'and a few drops of vanilla extract to one bowl.' 

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,720
'In the other, put 25 grams of chopped walnuts 

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,880
'and 1Â½ teaspoons of instant coffee granules 

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,840
'mixed with one-and-a-half teaspoons of milk. 

136
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
'This is what gives it a lovely colour and flavour.' 

137
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,880
- Now we have to fill the tins.
- OK. 

138
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,520
It smells lovely, the coffee flavour, doesn't it? 

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,840
- Coffee and walnut is a marriage made in heaven as far as I'm concerned. 
- It's lovely. 

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm going to level it right to the corners, 

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,720
it won't take its own shape by itself. 

142
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
And I'm straightening up the middle, 

143
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,640
- and this is what some of our bakers forgot to do, keep this level.
- Yes. 

144
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,080
Once the mixtures are level, 

145
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,760
sponges should be baked for about 25 minutes 

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,480
at 160 degrees centigrade or 140 fan. 

147
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Keeping their mixtures level was the least of the bakers' problems. 

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,160
All were relying on their own experience of cake making 

149
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,120
to decide how to execute the baking, 

150
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,760
cutting and building of this unique cake. 

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,120
I've never, ever made a Battenberg before, 

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,280
so I'm quite a bit anxious, really, but hopefully it'll be all OK. 

153
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,400
The first stumbling block was lining the tin, 

154
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,800
and Janet was already beginning to flap. 

155
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,400
It's a sort of new challenge, it's not something I've done before. 

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,000
Holly was relying on her origami skills to see her through. 

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't really know what I'm doing, 

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,600
I've done a bit of a Blue Peter job on the tin 

159
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,320
and it's going to be a big element of crossing my fingers. 

160
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,680
So I put all the coffee in the cake instead of half in the cake 

161
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
and half for the icing. 

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,440
I don't know, probably have a stronger flavour. 

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,680
The judges wanted strong flavour, so hey, I'm sure they'll like it. 

164
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,600
I think having a military background helps to some extent, 

165
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
following specific things to do, 

166
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,560
it makes up for the fact I'm a man, and multi tasking is a nightmare. 

167
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,520
Ben's method of checking whether the sponge was baked was spot on. 

168
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,480
It's as done as I can make it, we'll wait and see what happens with it. 

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm a bit worried that the foil is... 

170
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,120
Oh, so did you use the rigid foil? 

171
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,440
Well, the rigid foil is fine, it's the edges that have started to... 

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,000
- flick in a bit.
- So you're... OK. 

173
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm a little bit disappointed, actually. 

174
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,640
My foil's curled over so it's split away from the side, 

175
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,240
but hopefully I can rescue that with some marzipan. 

176
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
I'll have to trim it up nicely. 

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,840
One side's wider than the other side. 

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,400
So this has been brought out of the oven now and has been cooled. 

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,440
They look fantastic, so equal. What are you looking for? 

180
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,120
Well, I'm looking for them both to be of equal size. 

181
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,520
- It's shrinking away from the sides there.
- Yeah. 

182
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,720
That'll tell me it's done, and also the plain side, 

183
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,960
the vanilla side, is that lovely pale golden colour. 

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,200
- And then we cut it into two strips. 
- OK. 

185
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,280
'In order to start building the Battenberg, 

186
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,760
'pull the ends of the baking parchment away from each other. 

187
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,760
'Neaten up the edges of each sponge, 

188
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,720
'and then divide both evenly into two strips.' 

189
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
- Ideally, one should leave it half a day at least.
- Yeah. 

190
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
Because then it cuts evenly. Then we come to the buttercream. 

191
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,080
'Take 100 grams of icing sugar and 40 grams of butter at room temperature.' 

192
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,920
We've got coffee granules over there, half a teaspoon, if we put those... 

193
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,800
- In there?
- ..in there with 1Â½ teaspoonfuls of milk. 

194
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,960
There we are. 

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,240
But I think the coffee icing really complements it 

196
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,800
- and brings the whole thing together. 
- Yeah. 

197
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Now if you'd like to tip your icing sugar and butter on top of that. 

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,240
- Into there?
- Yeah. 

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
Just going to break up that butter. 

200
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
Then I'm going to get my hands in there. 

201
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
- Hands?
- Yeah. 

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,600
A true baker. 

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,760
Just imagine it's dough and it'll be perfect. 

204
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,320
I think there's something about using your hands in a bakery. 

205
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
It's going to go into hyper speed in a minute, all right? 

206
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Looks lovely and smooth. 

207
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,840
I think you get the feel for it, 

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,480
and if you're permanently using a mixer you haven't got that link. 

209
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,720
If you get your hands in there, 

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,880
you remember what it should be like. 

211
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,400
- If the phone rings, you use your other hand?
- Sometimes not. 

212
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,520
'Assembling the Battenberg is the next stage. 

213
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,200
'Use the buttercream to join one coffee strip 

214
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,480
'and one vanilla strip together. 

215
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,400
'Spread some icing across the top 

216
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,320
'and create the square with the remaining two pieces of cake.' 

217
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,240
Obviously, there's a slight drop on each side where it sits, 

218
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,680
cos you get a natural rise in the middle of the oven. 

219
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,720
Could you trim off the very ends? 

220
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,840
You certainly could at this stage if you wanted to, but I like to do it at the very end. 

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,560
Now we need 225 grams of marzipan, just making quite sure I haven't got any crumbs on my fingers 

222
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,920
cos that would mark the... make it non-perfect. 

223
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,560
Yes, the marzipan, yes. It's imperative at this stage to make sure the marzipan is clean, 

224
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,080
so you don't get all those indentations and possible breaks in it. 

225
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,360
So top tip is icing sugar on your rolling pin 

226
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,040
- rather than on the marzipan at this stage.
- Exactly. 

227
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,080
Just an even roll all the time, just like doing pastry. 

228
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,920
I know a few of them had a problem with the marzipan on the Battenberg, 

229
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,440
it did split, it did break, 

230
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,680
and it looked a bit of a mess on a few of them, to be honest. 

231
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
No, that didn't work. 

232
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
It's rubbish. 

233
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
I'm going to start again. Stupid thing. 

234
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
Sorry. 

235
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,320
I'm using cling wrap here 

236
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,720
because I didn't want the marzipan to stick to the roller. 

237
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,720
With some judicious encouragement, it can be persuaded to wrap round. 

238
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Is it going to match? 

239
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
That'll be at the bottom so they won't see that bit! 

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
'Once the marzipan is carefully rolled, place the assembled cake 

241
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,840
'into the middle, spread the remaining buttercream over the top. 

242
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,600
'Next, wrap the marzipan carefully around the sides of the cake 

243
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
'and massage it gently to bind it to the sponge. 

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,160
'Finally, trim off the edges to neaten both ends, 

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,120
'creating the perfect chequerboard effect.' 

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,960
- Do I ask a favour, can I crimp it on the top?
- You do the final finish. 

247
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,680
Well, if I do a little crimp, I think it sets it off, doesn't it, 

248
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,320
and it makes it look a little bit special. 

249
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,280
So we need just a few walnuts on that. 

250
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,960
I always think it's a good idea to have whatever's inside 

251
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,920
showing on top so people know. 

252
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,480
- How about doing five?
- OK. 

253
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,960
So that's our Battenberg, quite a challenge for our 12 bakers. 

254
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,320
When it came to judging, we were looking for the Battenberg that demonstrated the baking techniques, 

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,560
flavours and precision demanded by this recipe. 

256
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,400
This person has followed the recipe exactly. 

257
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,840
- It's been really well pressed into shape.
- It looks very pretty. 
- And businesslike. 

258
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Marzipan's very neat, that's nice. 

259
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,880
- This has been well-trimmed, it looks perfection.
- It's good flavour, good bake.
- A very good execution. 

260
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,080
And who has this one here? 

261
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,760
This is a masterpiece. 

262
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,880
Well done, Holly. 

263
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,240
I've been dying to get a piece of this. 

264
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,760
It looks very good. 

265
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,640
As a technical challenge, 

266
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,600
I thought the choice of the Battenberg, Mary, was superb. 

267
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, it was pushing them, and remember this was their first one, 

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,280
perhaps we were a little bit cruel to put it in so early. 

269
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,520
It was interesting when you talked to them, 

270
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,240
they all knew Battenberg, but very few of them had made them. 

271
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,720
It was tricky as the first technical challenge. 

272
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,160
I think getting all the sponges exactly the same, 

273
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,520
getting the good bake on the sponge itself in the first place, 

274
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,000
the blending of the buttercream and the smoothing of the buttercream between the sponges, 

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,320
ultimately, if they'd done that properly 

276
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,960
they would have ended up with a Battenberg like this. 

277
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,840
In the second round of the competition, we introduced pastry. 

278
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,800
Over two days and three challenges, we tested the bakers to the limit. 

279
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,360
The most difficult challenge of all was the second. 

280
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,320
The moment the technical bake was revealed, a ripple of fear swept through the tent. 

281
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,400
Deep breath, what we're going to be asking you to do 

282
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,080
is a tarte au citron. 

283
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,760
You know, Paul, tarte au citron, lemon tart, 

284
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,240
is quite my most favourite dessert or pastry tart. 

285
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,360
- Is that why you picked it for the technical challenge?
- Oh... 

286
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,200
You wanted to make it cos you liked it? 

287
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,760
Not really, because technically it's quite tricky to make, 

288
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,400
and there's an awful lot that can go wrong with it. 

289
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,760
But it is so good to eat, so popular, 

290
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,640
yet I think people are nervous of making it at home. 

291
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,320
So you're going to show us now the definitive lemon tart. 

292
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,800
- Exactly.
- OK. 

293
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,960
And so for that I'm going to make the pastry, 

294
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,880
- I'm going to do it in the processor. So, 175 grams of flour.
- Yeah. 

295
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,040
On the scales. 

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,680
- Is that absolutely right? 
- Nearly, getting there. 

297
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,360
- That's 175 grams. OK. 
- I'll put that into the processor. 

298
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,080
- You can do this by hand, can't you? 
- Oh, you can, yes, just put it straight into the bowl. 

299
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,360
- Then we're going to add the icing sugar, 25 grams.
- 25 grams. 

300
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,960
- I'm keeping a strong eye and you're up to 22 at the moment.
- I'm up to 24. 

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh, all right, and... 

302
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,440
Don't start taking your position... 

303
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,200
And these chefs, you know, they always use their hands. 

304
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,880
There you go. 

305
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,120
OK. So that is my 25 grams. 

306
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,360
And 100 grams of cold butter. Now we put that in the fridge, didn't we? 

307
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,760
Yes. 

308
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,160
In there, there we are. 

309
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,640
So at this stage you're just going to bind the ingredients to a breadcrumb consistency. 

310
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,400
Exactly. Press the button to go. 

311
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,480
- Can you see how it's changing now and becoming pale yellow?
- Yeah. 

312
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,760
- And it's just rubbed in as if you'd done it by hand.
- Yeah. 

313
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,440
But a lot quicker. 

314
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,280
Do you know what's happening in a molecular level? Can I bore you with science? 

315
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,280
The flour particles themselves are being coated with the fat from the butter or whatever fat you use, 

316
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,920
and that actually prevents the liquid coming out 

317
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,000
and too much gluten being formed. 

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
So when you add the water, you then work it, 

319
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
the more you work it, the more gluten is released through the fat 

320
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
but it limits the amount of gluten allowed out 

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,560
to stop it being too rubbery. 

322
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Very clever. 

323
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,320
And add one egg yolk to that. 

324
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,960
- There you go, one egg yolk straight in?
- That's it, and some water. A tablespoon. 

325
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Now, measuring spoons are an essential part of my life. 

326
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,800
Everybody can make pastry if they weigh accurately, 

327
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,240
so I'm going to keep an eye on that. 

328
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,720
And when I see it coming together... 

329
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,840
So that's your basic sweet pastry mix. 

330
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,080
That is basic sweet pastry, and I use it for all sorts of things. 

331
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,720
So it's interesting that you use icing sugar rather than castor sugar. 

332
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,360
It makes a better dough. I think. 

333
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,680
- Smoother dough, smooth. 
- A smoother dough. 

334
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,160
- Now you just knead that a little bit for me.
- Yeah. 

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
Just knead it. 

336
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,360
I only knead it a little bit. Now that is a skill I haven't got yet. 

337
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,760
- Right, I've just got some non-stick parchment.
- Yeah. 

338
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,480
And the size I'm going to make is 23 centimetres, 

339
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,800
about an inch high, 

340
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,360
and this is the way that I do it, 

341
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,680
because I was taught to roll out the pastry into a big sheet 

342
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,720
then put it round the rolling pin. 

343
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,840
- The way I normally do it, yes. 
- Well, so often, if you haven't made it perfectly, it cracks. 

344
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
And so, this way, it doesn't. 

345
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,040
So if you put that as your base, and you know you've got to make it sort of an inch bigger all round. 

346
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,360
That's a nice tip. 

347
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,720
Then you put that in the middle, and you roll it out. 

348
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,760
And try to keep it round... round again here. 

349
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,960
- It's just all about being gentle, isn't it? Just easing it out to the side.
- It's gentle, gentle. 

350
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,040
But light hands - you notice I'm not pressing it and it's got to be fairly even. 

351
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,240
- There, now you can actually see the circle...
- Yes. 

352
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,360
- ..underneath.
- Clearly. 
- That looks just about right to me. 

353
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,680
Right, now how am I going to get it into there? 

354
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,600
Very simply. What you do is you take the pastry 

355
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,120
and you just turn it in like that... and you see, 

356
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,360
if I tried to put that over the rolling pin... 

357
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,080
it would more than likely crack. 

358
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,240
Then you just take that and you put that in there, there it is, 

359
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,160
and then very simply lift this over the side. 

360
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
You notice that I've got lots of spare. 

361
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm going to leave that exactly there. 

362
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,160
Usually, I don't chill it before I roll it out, 

363
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,240
but if it's warm like today, you can chill it for five minutes. 

364
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,800
It's a good idea, again, just to solidify the butter that's in there. 

365
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
It makes it a little bit easier to work. 

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,120
Firmly press the pastry into the grooves of the tin. 

367
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,560
'Once it's lined, prick the base so it doesn't balloon up while baking, 

368
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,360
line it with foil and some baking beans to weigh it down. 

369
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,320
Bake the case for around ten minutes at 200 degrees centigrade, 

370
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,040
180 fan, while you make the filling. 

371
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,320
You will need the zest of four unwaxed lemons 

372
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,080
and 150ml of lemon juice. 

373
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,840
For the filling break five eggs into a bowl 

374
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,440
and whisk together with 225 grams of caster sugar. 

375
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,440
If you used granulated sugar, you would get speckles 

376
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,360
on top of the tart. 

377
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,440
Whisk until it becomes smooth, then add the zest and lemon juice 

378
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,320
and mix again until they're well combined. 

379
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Finally, add 125ml of double cream. 

380
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,040
It's time to check on the pastry case. 

381
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,960
- There you go.
- That's it. 

382
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,000
- Right, now, can you see that's got a gentle brown on the outside?
- Yes. 

383
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,360
And then just lift it out... and you notice how it doesn't stick. 

384
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,560
And you can see now that most of the pricking has filled up the holes. 

385
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
- Yes.
- It looks underdone in the middle.
- Mmm. 

386
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,560
And therefore, that has to go back in the oven 

387
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,760
for 10 to 12 minutes until it dries out. 

388
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,440
- So you're going to take that to its full bake before it goes back in with the filling?
- Exactly, 

389
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,480
because remember when we were judging - 

390
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,960
and we've got a thing about a soggy bottom - 

391
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,000
you've got to get that bottom of the pastry really, really dry. 

392
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,640
'The pastry needs another ten to 15 minutes 

393
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,680
'until it is completely dried out. 

394
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,400
'When the pastry case is fully baked, allow it to cool. 

395
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,960
'To finish off the tart, transfer the filling to a jug 

396
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,040
'and give it a quick stir to check the lemon zest is well mixed in.' 

397
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,800
Now, most people, I expect, would pour that into there, 

398
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,080
walk to the oven, and, with a not very steady hand, 

399
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,880
it might go over the side and get between the pastry and the tin. 

400
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,960
- Mmm.
- So, if you put that on the oven shelf...
- In the oven now?
- Yes. 

401
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,040
..and then you just gently pour that in... 

402
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,600
And as a matter of interest, that was exactly a pint. 

403
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,840
- So, that's ready to bake?
- Yes, it's in the oven and the oven is set. 

404
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,000
Overcook it, 

405
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,040
and it might have bubbles in it, 

406
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,920
- which would toughen it.
- Mmm. 

407
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,720
And if you overcook it, a crack will form. 

408
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,080
To know when it's done - and we'll have a look at it - it should have a wobble in the middle. 

409
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,640
'Bake the tart at 160 centigrade, or 140 fan, for about 35 minutes.' 

410
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,200
'I've always considered that the level of skill of a good pastry chef 

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,840
'can be measured by their ability to make a perfect lemon tart.' 

412
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm scared that I'll mess it up big time if I still do that. 

413
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
A lot of fear coming through. 

414
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,840
It's making Mary's lemon tart for Mary. 

415
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,600
'With only 1Â½ hours on the clock, 

416
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,840
'the bakers were up against it. 

417
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,320
'There are no short cuts when making a perfect lemon tart. 

418
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
'Janet's pastry looks slightly overworked.' 

419
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,760
- Yes, it's looking a little bit gunky.
- What, the pastry? 

420
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,800
Yes, but maybe it'll be OK. 

421
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,760
I have done a tarte au citron in the past, 

422
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,680
not with quite such a sticky pastry. 

423
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,600
But we'll do with what we've got. 

424
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,440
'It wasn't just making the pastry that was tricky. 

425
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,920
'Blind baking was also causing problems.' 

426
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,000
There's a little crack in the bottom of my case, you know. 

427
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,920
Hopefully, it will do the job. 

428
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,840
It's all in the pastry, the crunch, and it looks all right, 

429
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,240
but God, who knows? 

430
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,440
- Oh, no...
- Jo, are we facing the collapse of the pastry wall? 

431
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,280
- Yes, hah, we are.
- OK. 

432
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,040
I've never had it collapse on me or anything before, 

433
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,800
but I'm making silly mistakes and I don't really know why. 

434
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,720
I think wishy-washy lemon's not worth having, you know, 

435
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,960
I think if you have something lemony, it's got to be really sharp. 

436
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
So it sort of gets all your jaws going, you know. 

437
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,200
'The technique of filling the cases whilst in the oven eluded some of the bakers.' 

438
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,040
- Oh, no, this is terrible. 
- Please, please! 

439
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,280
'The bakers all had their own views when to take the tart out of the oven.' 

440
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,520
Out you come... 

441
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,240
You're supposed to take it out 

442
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
when there's just a little wobble in the middle, 

443
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,600
so I've applied that principle and, fingers crossed, it'll work. 

444
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,320
I don't think it's a disaster, 

445
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,040
it doesn't look like a disaster cos at least it's not runny. 

446
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,480
When you're cooking something like this lemon tart, overcook it, 

447
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
and it might have bubbles in it, which would toughen it, 

448
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,040
and a crack will form. 

449
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,480
That looks beautiful. 

450
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,080
Then you want to leave it in the tin so that the pastry will shrink back from the outside. 

451
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,320
If you try and turn it out now, it could well stick. 

452
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,560
'Leave the tart in its tin for about ten to 15 minutes to cool. 

453
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,480
'Carefully remove the tart from the tin, slide it off its base 

454
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,440
'onto the serving plate, then dust liberally with icing sugar to serve.' 

455
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,720
It really makes the most beautiful dessert, or even little wedges of it for tea. 

456
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,840
I'm looking forward to that one, Mary. 

457
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,720
'When it came to judging, while some looked impressive, 

458
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,480
'others fell short with thick, burned crusts and cracked tops.' 

459
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Good gracious, 11 really lovely tarte au citrons. 

460
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,240
'And when we cut and tasted them, 

461
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,760
'I couldn't believe how different they were, 

462
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,840
'considering they were all from the same recipe.' 

463
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,320
It's a bit thick on the pastry. 

464
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,000
- Tastes good, but you expect that, it's a Mary Berry recipe. 
- THEY LAUGH 

465
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,840
There's a crack in the top of this one, it is slightly over baked. 

466
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,560
A thinner pastry on this one. 

467
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,440
I think that the blind bake wasn't long enough. 

468
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,560
- Mmm. And that's been boiled. 
- Nice to have thin pastry, though. 

469
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,320
This one looks like a patchwork quilt. 

470
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,360
- You see the different colours. 
- That's the join in the pastry. 

471
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
This one looks good. 

472
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,160
Thin crust, it is not shrinking away from the side, 

473
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,560
the filling is beautifully creamy. 

474
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,640
- Lemon tart, or as the French call it, tarte au citron.
- Cut a slice.
- Mmm. 

475
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,000
- Was that going through like butter? 
- It cuts extremely well. 

476
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,560
Looking down the side of that, there isn't a bubble in the filling. 

477
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,360
But most important of all is underneath, 

478
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
the pastry should be very thin 

479
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,680
and a lovely golden brown. 

480
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,760
Mmm. 

481
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,600
It's so delicate. Yet the beautiful lemon coming through. 

482
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,280
It is a tricky thing to get a perfect lemon tart 

483
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,440
and if it's baked properly, 

484
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,960
that's exactly how it should be. 

485
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,600
'Week three, and we decided it was time to test the bakers 

486
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,560
'on their bread-making skills, my personal passion.' 

487
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,680
Got too much salt in it. 

488
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Your technical recipe for this challenge is focaccia. 

489
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,600
And to add a little bit of pressure, 

490
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,560
you will be working with master baker Paul Hollywood's own recipe. 

491
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,480
So Paul, out of all the breads you could have chosen, 

492
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,840
why did you chose focaccia for a technical challenge for the bakers? 

493
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,960
I chose the focaccia because it's extremely difficult to make. Cos this dough is extremely wet, 

494
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,520
and the flour to water the ratio is nearly one to one, 

495
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,720
so you can imagine, it's almost like a wet jelly 

496
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,040
and very difficult to handle. 

497
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,080
These are the best amateur bakers this country has to offer 

498
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,880
and if I can't push THEM, what's the point? 

499
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,320
But I'm going to show you how you can incorporate 

500
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,600
that much water into a mix, so what we're going to do is 

501
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,920
to start with some flour, some strong, white flour. 

502
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,600
- Right.
- Now I'm going to weigh up 500 grams, all right?
- Right. 

503
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,360
I'll keep an eye on you that it's absolutely accurate. 

504
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,440
- You're on your way, two more grams. 
- OK, 500. 

505
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,040
Exactly right. And strong flour. 

506
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Strong, white bread flour. 

507
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,840
This has a higher protein level, therefore a higher gluten level. 

508
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,920
Gluten - glue, 

509
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,120
the glue that binds the structure, 

510
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,600
the holes in the loaf together, keeps it strong. 

511
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,520
- Now, yeast.
- Yes. 

512
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,240
Three different types of yeast here, 

513
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,640
- you have what's called fast-action yeast.
- Usually in little packets. 

514
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,400
Yes, or the powdered yeast, which you get in little sachets. 

515
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,040
The middle one is a dried yeast. 

516
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,520
This one you have to reconstitute with water, sugar, 

517
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,840
mix it and then leave it for 15 minutes to froth and bubble. 

518
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,520
- Load of nonsense, don't use it. 
- Right.
- This particular yeast 

519
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,320
- is the fresh stuff.
- Mmm. 
- Fast-action yeast is the dried version of that. Therefore, 

520
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,240
if you base that as a concentrate, 

521
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,400
you use a third less in the powdered. 

522
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,880
So it's fast-action dried yeast that we're to use. 

523
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,920
Fast-action yeast, so I'm putting that straight in, two sachets of seven grams. 

524
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,600
- Right.
- The next thing I'm going to do is add a glug of olive oil, 

525
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,360
30ml, I need - one, two, three. 

526
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,160
That might have been a bit too much, may it? 

527
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,480
No, it's fine. Salt. 

528
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm using normal cooking salt. And I'm actually going to use ten grams. 

529
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,640
If you're using measuring spoons, that would be a dessert spoon. 

530
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,440
I'm not into all that stuff, that is bizarre. 

531
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,320
I know, but WE like to be accurate and we have a little set of spoons. 

532
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,160
- OK.
- You can do it...
- Is that the royal "we"?
- Us home bakers. 

533
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,320
OK, so, in there, we have the core ingredients 

534
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,680
to make the most magical food known to man. Or woman. 

535
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,040
In this jug, I've got cool water, 

536
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,240
- not warm water.
- Cool water? 

537
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,960
- Just tap water, straight from the tap.
- Right.
- 400ml. 

538
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,400
Straight into the bowl, start off about half way. 

539
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,320
Because it takes so much water, this dough, 

540
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
you never add the full amount straight away. 

541
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,680
- More water in again.
- But you are going to include all that 400ml? 

542
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,240
Oh, yes. 

543
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,880
At this stage, I'm just turning it, to see how much liquid it's going to pick up. 

544
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
And again it's still more. 

545
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,760
But you gave them definite instructions that they had to 

546
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,560
use all that 400ml of water, and they didn't believe your recipe. 

547
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,760
They actually started to change the recipe 

548
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,080
because they thought it was wrong. 

549
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,360
'Making focaccia is a test of raw baking skill, 

550
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,240
'where technique is important. 

551
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,000
'But respecting the fluid to flour ratio in my wet dough recipe 

552
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,160
'is absolutely vital. 

553
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,920
'Making focaccia is a real test, 

554
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,600
'most people have never worked with a dough so wet, 

555
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,480
'and a lot of our bakers found it difficult to believe that the recipe was actually correct.' 

556
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,640
I think this has been the scariest technical challenge so far, 

557
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,160
because I've got no idea if I'm getting it right. 

558
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,760
'Rob thought he understood the recipe, as he's very familiar with 'bread-making techniques.' 

559
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,520
Have you made focaccia before? 

560
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,840
- I've not, but I think I kind of know the theory of it.
- Which is? 

561
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Well, just that cos it's meant to have those cool little holes with the layers, 

562
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,560
and the holes come from the wet of the dough. 

563
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,880
'But the extra wet dough in my focaccia recipe caused plenty of confusion.' 

564
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,680
This is baffling me, I've never made such a wet dough before. 

565
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't know how this is going to come together, but I'll give it a good go. 

566
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,640
And now add the remaining water. 

567
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,120
It doesn't say how to add it, but I'm just going to sort of, you know... 

568
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,680
- Just whack it in there, mate. 
- Strange.
- It is weird, isn't it? 

569
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,560
It is weird... Oh, gosh. 

570
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,080
'Ben was fighting the urge to deviate from the method.' 

571
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,960
And the temptation is just to 

572
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,840
put more flour into it to get to a dough that you're used to using, 

573
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,600
and so you have to kind of go, "No, no flour, no flour." 

574
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,240
- Have you got any more water to add? 
- I've got about... 

575
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,960
- just under 100 left. 
- It's, I mean, it's up to you. 

576
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm kind of liking the way it's behaving at the moment. 

577
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,360
'Jo seemed confident that my recipe was right.' 

578
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,560
Obviously Paul knows what he's doing, 

579
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,560
so hopefully this will turn out OK. 

580
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,120
- It's actually coming together quite well.
- Yes, there you are... 

581
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,040
- Looks very stretchy now. 
- It's getting that way now. 

582
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,200
What I'm going to try and do, is try and stretch it on some olive oil. 

583
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,720
- So, plenty of olive oil on there. 
- Right. 

584
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,280
Now, the idea of the olive oil on the table is not to... 

585
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,080
You don't want any more flour added to that mixture? 

586
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,880
No, so I'm just stretching it... and placing it in the middle. 

587
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
Kneading this is actually very difficult because it's so wet. 

588
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,400
So what you're doing is stretching it 

589
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,960
to try and build up the gluten in it, that's all I'm doing. 

590
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,720
You can see it's starting to get quite smooth already, you know? 

591
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,280
It's so good to see you doing this, because if I was at home doing that 

592
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,160
without your demonstration, I would think that that was just a bit wet. 

593
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,840
Well, look at the... 

594
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,280
- it's not moving, it's not flowing out, it's quite a stable dough.
- Yes. 

595
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
You see how smooth it's getting now. 

596
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,680
No need to go to the gym when you do Paul Hollywood's bread, is there? 

597
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,240
HE CHUCKLES 

598
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,280
OK, at that stage, I'm going to put it in that glass bowl there - 

599
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,960
can you pass me that glass bowl? 

600
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,760
- Right.
- This is a two-litre glass container, OK?
- Right. 

601
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Olive oil just to stop the dough from sticking, 

602
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,000
rub it all the way round the sides... 

603
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,560
- and then place your dough in there. Flatten it down slightly.
- Mmm. 

604
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,000
Then are you going to cover that or leave it open? 

605
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,160
I'm actually going to cover it. 

606
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,080
- The only reason why I'm covering it is to stop a skin.
- Yes. 

607
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,240
The gluten that has been built up, it will activate the yeast, 

608
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,600
the yeast will start to produce carbon dioxide, 

609
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,440
and it will start to grow. 

610
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,960
And you leave that to rise in kitchen temperature? 

611
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,800
Kitchen temperature, living room temperature, bedroom temperature. 

612
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,000
But not in... Putting it in a linen cupboard or above a radiator, 

613
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,120
it just speeds up. 

614
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Absolutely not, do not speed up the rising process, 

615
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,640
let nature do the work. 

616
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,920
And it'll take about an hour for the focaccia to double in size. 

617
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,160
Mary, can you pass me my bubbling mass of dough, please? 

618
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
Looks like a volcanic eruption. 

619
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,880
- There you are. 
- If I just take this off carefully... 
- Yes.
- Peel that off round there. 

620
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,840
And it's right up like that because your dough was very wet to start with? 

621
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Very wet, it's got no resistance because the dough is not tight, so it will just... 

622
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
it will just blow. 

623
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,760
And when you put it in a container, there is only one place that dough can go - straight up. 

624
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,040
Now, if you look at the structure of the dough down here and all down the side... 

625
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,240
- Right.
- ..you see the structure. 
- Masses of little holes. 

626
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,640
There is masses of holes. 

627
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,240
And that structure down there 

628
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,320
is an indication of what your final bread will be like. 

629
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
Now, if I lift this up gently, 

630
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,760
see how stringy it is? 

631
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,760
- It's all stretchy and stringy. 
- That, there, is the gluten. Nature - 

632
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,920
I've taken it to a level of kneading - 

633
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,680
nature has done the rest. 

634
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,440
Right, I will need two baking trays, please, Mary. 

635
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,760
- Right, we've got some under here. 
- Yes, down there. 

636
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,880
Does that mean, this amount, the 500 grams, is going to make two? 

637
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,920
- One big one, or two little ones. 
- Right.
- OK? 

638
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,760
Now, at the moment, that's just got blind baking parchment on there. 

639
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,080
- Yes.
- Little bit of olive oil on the bottom, rub that in.
- Mmm. 

640
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,960
- What I'm going to do first is tip this dough out onto an oiled surface.
- Right. 

641
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,640
OK, there's your piece of dough. 

642
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,560
OK, we'll stretch this out a bit. 

643
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,720
- Can I have a feel of that? 
- Yeah, course you can. 

644
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,320
It's really, very, very, wet and stretchy, 

645
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,280
every time you pull it out it comes back. 

646
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,880
Just cutting the dough in half... 

647
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,400
OK, what I'm going to do is lift this up as a blob, stretch it, 

648
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,960
place it onto the tray. 

649
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,160
OK? Now, you're going to do this one. Easy tiger, 

650
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,480
wait, I'm going to put the rest of it in, OK? 

651
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,440
What we need to do, just gently press down, 

652
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,400
that down motion will naturally take it to the side, anyway. 

653
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,840
- Shall I write my name on this one so I know it's mine?
- If you want to. 

654
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,560
- I missed a bit there.
- Fantastic. 

655
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,480
This is the skill of the bread maker - you've got it, Mary. 

656
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,000
'Once in a tin, the dough needs to be left to rise again, 

657
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,520
'uncovered, at room temperature, for about an hour.' 

658
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,840
At this stage, would you add some rosemary or some olives or anything like that? 

659
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,600
This is a stage where you'd add tomatoes on the top, cherry tomatoes. 

660
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,680
Potatoes, sliced up on the top, absolutely delicious on there, 

661
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,280
and again, you can add any herb you want to. 

662
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,160
'To add moistness and flavour, drizzle a little more oil 

663
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,200
'over the top and push your fingers in to create dimples.' 

664
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,760
'It was entirely up to the bakers how long to prove for.' 

665
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
Let me see yours. 

666
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,160
If it hasn't risen, then I've just wasted an hour. 

667
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,320
I'll be honest, I don't think it's number one, but you never know. 

668
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,920
'As the bakers added the final touches to their focaccia, 

669
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,520
'confidence in the bread was rising. 

670
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,520
'Although Mary-Anne's dough was an odd shape, she seemed happy with it.' 

671
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
It's a bit lopsided, but it'll do, it'll do... 

672
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,200
..fingers crossed. 

673
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Now, what quality olive oil would you use to go on the loaf here? 

674
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,520
Before bake, non virgin, after bake virgin olive oil. 

675
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,800
So it's not so much the flavour, but you want that flavour afterwards, 

676
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,560
cos afterwards, when it comes out of the oven, we put more olive oil on. 

677
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,880
'Lightly dust your focaccia with a little sea salt 

678
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,640
'and then bake in the oven for about 20 minutes at 220 degrees centigrade 

679
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,320
'or 200 degrees in a fan oven.' 

680
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,560
- Ooh, gosh, that looks good. 
- You can smell it, can't you? 

681
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,960
- I can see my fingerprints.
- Two. And I've got some olive oil here.
- Right. 

682
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,640
- Some good olive oil.
- Right. 
- Again, drizzle a little bit on top. 

683
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,960
- And it needs nothing else. 
- And that's how you make a focaccia - 

684
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,520
it's simple, a bit stagy, 

685
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,200
a bit fiddly, but this will be packed full of flavour. 

686
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,640
I really can't wait to taste them, they look wonderful. This one's mine. 

687
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,640
'When judging our bakers' focaccias, 

688
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,000
'I had a very specific idea of exactly what I wanted to see.' 

689
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
What I'm looking for is thin, not fat. 

690
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,360
If you think a focaccia should be this big, you're mistaken. 

691
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,080
That's the British version of the focaccia, not the Italian version. 

692
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,320
This has got a crisper top and the aeration is uneven, as you like it to be. 

693
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,240
Mmm, try this one, Mary. 

694
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,200
Someone's not been following my recipe... There's too much flour in there. 

695
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Someone's thought, "Paul's made a mistake here. 

696
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,480
"I don't think I'll add all the water." 

697
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,600
I mean, you look at that strata, it's not irregular enough, 

698
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,560
and it's quite dry, it shouldn't be like that. 

699
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,600
- This one's a bit bready again. 
- Has a nice crust though.
- Mmm. 

700
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,880
- This one looks a bit better, see the strata on that one?
- It's... 

701
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,600
These massive air holes, these huge things you hit every now and again are great. 

702
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
That's one of the best ones I've seen for quite a while as well. 

703
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
- Thank you.
- Well done. 

704
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
So, this is focaccia, 

705
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,640
and it WILL be good because it's Paul Hollywood. 

706
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,520
Mary, can I offer you some? 

707
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,800
I'll do the traditional break, there you go, there's some for you. Some for me. 

708
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,440
Now, when you look at the actual structure, 

709
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,160
it's quite an irregular crumb, big holes, little holes. 

710
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,520
It's not regular. That's the crucial thing with a focaccia 

711
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,480
and that is brought about by the sheer amount, 

712
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,680
volume of water in that dough. 

713
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,960
I think it was really difficult for the bakers 

714
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,800
because when you go and buy focaccia, very often it is thick. 

715
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,000
And I think that it was difficult for them to get the thin one like you're saying, 

716
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
weren't quite sure what they were going to end up with. 

717
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,560
- It's the texture, it's the look.
- Right. 

718
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,360
And obviously olive oil, lots and lots of olive oil, 

719
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,040
that's what gives you the flavour. 

720
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,840
We've got very exciting things suggested that we have with it. 

721
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,960
Parma ham and things, but I like it just as it is. 

722
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,240
- It's absolutely beautiful. 
- So you like it then, Mary? 

723
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,600
- I don't like it, I absolutely love it.
- Mmm. 

724
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,440
- And I think this would be my perfect lunch.
- Delicious. 

725
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,200
- And, of course, a glass of wine. 
- Oh, of course... Cheers, Mary. 

726
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,120
'With only eight remaining in the competition, 

727
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,480
'week four of the Great British Bake Off 

728
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,080
'was all about creating the perfect biscuit. 

729
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,720
'The technical bake was Mary's brandy snaps recipe. 

730
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,440
'Tasty and brittle, the success of a brandy snap lies in its name, the snap.' 

731
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
What we'd like you to do 

732
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,560
is to make 24...brandy snaps. 

733
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,360
We need them to be of equal colour, size, 

734
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,360
and we'd like them filled with whipped cream. 

735
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,920
So, Mary, brandy snaps, chosen for a technical challenge. Tricky? 

736
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,360
It's quite tricky, as our bakers found. 

737
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,240
And you've got to make it to the right consistency, 

738
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,960
you've got to get the sugar dissolved 

739
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,400
and you've got to space them properly on the tray. 

740
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,240
Quite tricky, but fun to do. 

741
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,440
The recipe itself is immensely simple and easy to remember. 

742
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,800
- So if you take 50 grams of butter. 
- Yes. 

743
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,640
Next is sugar, Demerara sugar 

744
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,240
and if you can spread that over the top evenly 

745
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,880
when we put the golden syrup on top, 

746
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,000
it won't stick to the pan. 

747
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,720
- That's it.
- OK. 

748
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,160
And then the golden syrup on the top, again 50 grams. 

749
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,360
50 grams of golden syrup. 

750
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,280
In ounces, it's two ounces of all three things. 

751
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,080
Almost there...exactly. 

752
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,560
So we then put that onto the hot plate like that 

753
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,320
and it's very important to dissolve this very slowly 

754
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,080
because if you don't, it will crystallise 

755
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,680
and then it crystallises and it holds in one piece. 

756
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,240
But you've got to get rid of the grittiness 

757
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,880
and that's just melting the sugar so it really is on a low heat 

758
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,160
and keep an eye on it. 

759
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,080
And when you no longer have any grittiness at the bottom, 

760
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,920
then you know that it's done. 

761
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,560
'It will take about ten to 15 minutes to get the right consistency, 

762
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,600
'which should be smooth and glossy. 

763
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
'Take it off the heat and allow it to cool 

764
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,360
'for a few minutes before adding the remaining ingredients.' 

765
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,720
So that's 50 grams of flour, if you can weigh that up. 

766
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,680
50 grams of plain flour. 

767
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,640
That's exactly right, then we're going to add 

768
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,520
half a teaspoonful of ginger, so that goes in like that. 

769
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,840
And just sieve in the ginger and the flour, 

770
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,880
so there it is going in. 

771
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,360
Now if you add the flour to that 

772
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,280
when it's really, really hot, it doesn't go in smoothly. 

773
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,000
And you beat that in and at the end we will add the lemon juice. 

774
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,800
- Just half a teaspoon. 
- Is that purely for flavour? 

775
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,520
It's purely for flavour and it's traditional to add it. 

776
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,840
- Got a lovely consistency, a lovely shine to it.
- Perfect. 

777
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,800
It's a good thing for, sort of, 

778
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,800
teenagers to make at home, cos it's quite fun. 

779
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,200
Teenagers just throw it round the house, Mary. 

780
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,760
No, they wouldn't. 

781
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,280
Now I need an ordinary teaspoon to put them out on here. 

782
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,600
- So you want some non-stick parchment. 
- Yes. 

783
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,200
You don't need to grease it and you put four on here. 

784
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,960
And it's no good trying to put too many on a tray at once, 

785
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,400
- because if you do, they all run into each other.
- Yes. 

786
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,280
And you just, sort of, spoon them around like that. 

787
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,760
Can anything go wrong to get to that stage? 

788
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,080
If you haven't dissolved the sugar properly, you don't get a good result. 

789
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,400
And also you need to let it get cool enough before you add the flour. 

790
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,240
How big will these grow? You've left four on there. 

791
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,720
Could you have left more of a gap or is that adequate? 

792
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,920
They will run almost together, that's about right. 

793
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,560
Just leaving an equal space between them. 

794
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,520
'Bake the brandy snaps at 180 degrees centigrade or 160 fan.' 

795
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,200
And then really it's a matter of watching them 

796
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,280
and they want to spread, so that they have little holes in them. 

797
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,160
Rather like lace. 

798
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,880
Everything that can and will go wrong with baking 

799
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,160
is encapsulated in the simple snap of a single biscuit. 

800
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,400
All of the bakers may have tasted them before, 

801
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,720
but few have attempted making them. 

802
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,160
For many, including Yasmin, the measurements 

803
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,480
and timings proved difficult to grasp. 

804
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,120
How much is a portion? 

805
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,480
It's getting too complicated and I've only got an hour and a half. 

806
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,520
I'm concerned about timings, it's a lot, 24. 

807
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,680
when you can only get four on each. 

808
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,880
Then I'm going to oil the spoon handles. 

809
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,520
Now you can do them on bigger handles than this, 

810
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,760
small rolling pins, depends what size you want them. 

811
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,200
I've done tuiles and we put them on broom handles 

812
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,320
hanging all over the pastry department. 

813
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,600
Yes, that's a good idea 

814
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,280
- or it could be small rolling pins, couldn't it?
- Yes. 

815
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,520
That's it. 

816
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,560
You're going for quite a cigarillo, cigar shape on this one? 

817
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,800
So you do have to put a fair bit of oil on them? 

818
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
You do, it should be a flavourless oil, 

819
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,720
not, obviously, a virgin olive oil or something. 

820
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,320
Or you can do it with butter, it's so they don't stick. 

821
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,760
- Yes.
- How are they doing in the oven? 
- Let's have a look. 

822
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,480
They do look like lace so I think it's time to come out. 

823
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,960
Well, that's what they should look like, good. 

824
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,600
They look absolutely right to me. 

825
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,880
I wouldn't be able to roll them at this stage as they're too soft. 

826
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,560
- Yes. 
- Can you see there, look?
- Yes. 

827
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,440
When doing more than four at one go, 

828
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,840
if some of them go hard on the tray, 

829
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,040
you can always just put them back in the oven to soften up again. 

830
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,880
- So there is a bit of leeway both sides?
- There is. 

831
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,240
You've got to let them get cool enough to roll. 

832
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,920
As you can see, at the moment they're not. 

833
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,440
Coming from a hot oven to a cool environment, 

834
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,240
they start to solidify quite rapidly don't they? 

835
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,440
Cos essentially it's the sugars in there beginning to set. 

836
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,240
That looks about right, let's put it on here 

837
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,520
and you notice how I'm putting the frilly side towards the outside. 

838
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,320
- Yes. 
- So you do that and roll it round. 

839
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,840
- And you can sort of squeeze it with the hand and leave it on.
- Yes. 

840
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,280
And then if you want to make little baskets, 

841
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,760
you can either put it on top of an orange like this... 

842
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,040
There we are. 

843
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't forget to oil the oranges if you're doing them, 

844
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,040
or an apple or anything that's that sort of shape. 

845
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
SHE SIGHS 

846
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,360
If the brandy snaps are not baked enough, 

847
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,000
they won't roll properly as Jo discovered. 

848
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,480
Mine have just not gone right today. Just can't get them right. 

849
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,360
Rob had his own odd ideas to create a consistent batch. 

850
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,040
Rob, what went wrong here, love? 

851
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,200
No, no, no, it's not what's gone wrong, 

852
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,080
- I'm cutting them out using the cutter.
- Oh. 

853
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,000
Janet was struggling with the hot mix. 

854
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,080
Phew, need asbestos fingers. 

855
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,920
It's just very painful, it's almost like torture. 

856
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,560
And, finally, Jo realised her mistake was really rather basic. 

857
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,400
Oh, what it might have been is my oven is on the wrong temperature. 

858
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,200
- My oven was on defrost. 
- SHE SIGHS 

859
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,040
Once they're cooled, it's time to fill them with whipped cream. 

860
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,840
The consistency of the cream needs to be thick and light, 

861
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,120
but not too stiff. 

862
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,280
That looks about right to me. 

863
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,320
- It's so easy to over whip cream. 
- Yes. 

864
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,520
And I'd rather have it as it was a little bit slack, 

865
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,520
drop that down to the bottom... 

866
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,400
Bit more in there, that's about right. 

867
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,640
So, just shake it down like that. 

868
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:59,560
Then when you're icing a cake, you very often just put two folds 

869
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,360
like that and then fold it down, but I find it much easier 

870
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,560
to grasp it in one hand, put the other one there 

871
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,920
and then twist the top. 

872
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,360
And then see when it gets to that stage that it's just coming out. 

873
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,720
- Yes.
- Magic. 

874
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,040
Right, we're ready. We've slipped these off. 

875
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,360
Now, now they are quite hard. You can hear. 

876
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,520
Yeah, they are. 

877
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,520
And then put it round your thumb like that at the top. 

878
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,480
And then push it gently down, 

879
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,160
holding it steady till it comes out of the end. 

880
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,720
Turn it round, and put it in the other end. 

881
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,640
Obviously, you wouldn't fill these until about an hour 

882
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,480
- before you need them, ideally. 
- Yes. 

883
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,000
But these will keep well in an airtight tin. 

884
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,920
Now, if by any chance the tin isn't airtight or you're keeping them for over a week, 

885
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,560
- they become a bit soft.
- Yes. 

886
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,520
So what you do is gently warm them in a low oven. 

887
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,920
Spread them out flat on the baking sheet and then 

888
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,000
put them in a low oven just until they're in the stage of before 

889
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,280
- you roll them and you can roll them up again and they'll be crisp. 
- Do the same thing again. 

890
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,440
- Exactly.
- Very versatile recipe. 

891
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,720
- The world is your oyster. 
- Let's see what we can do with this one. 

892
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,560
What I've got here is just melted down a little bit of white chocolate, 

893
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,000
that's just brushed inside all over. 

894
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,080
Oh, how delicious. 

895
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,040
It adds a little bit of flavour to it as well which is 

896
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,360
essentially what you're doing, you're adding another element to it, which can then be filled with cream. 

897
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,560
Now, white chocolate is quite temperamental and it's essential 

898
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,240
to melt it slowly, isn't it? 

899
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,760
- Yes, yes, definitely. 
- If you overheat it it'll get exceedingly runny. 

900
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,440
- Yes. 
- And it in fact won't set up again. 

901
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Exactly, all I'm trying to do, cos you have got holes in this, 

902
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,920
and what this is doing, is just covering those holes 

903
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,960
- and you can put that in a fridge to set the white chocolate.
- Mmm-hmm. 
- Then you can just get some cream... 

904
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,000
..fill it all the way to the top. 

905
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,880
One more element I think is missing. 

906
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,320
Get a strawberry, just cut it not quite to the green. 

907
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,440
You're going to have a nice fan. 

908
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,640
Yes, slice it six or seven times, 

909
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,840
push it down... 

910
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,120
..place that on the top. 

911
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,560
I think that looks very pretty as well. 

912
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,080
Doesn't that look lovely? 

913
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,880
At the end of the challenge a variety of snaps were delivered to our judging table. 

914
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,720
They come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? 

915
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,280
When it came to tasting we were very particular in what we were looking for, 

916
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,160
a beautiful golden structure, a good snap, 

917
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,840
and consistency across the batch. 

918
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,680
They don't snap. A brandy snap should snap. 

919
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,640
- These are sort of cocktail size. 
- Yes. 

920
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,920
- Too small for the amount of mixture. 
- Mmm. 

921
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,800
Very inconsistent. There's no consistency in colour, is there? Flavour's OK. 

922
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,120
Flavour's OK and it's lovely and crisp. 

923
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,160
This is a mess. 

924
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,880
They're too pale. 

925
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,120
Like rubber. 

926
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,800
I turned my oven onto defrost by accident. 

927
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,240
Ah, that doesn't help. 

928
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,480
These are consistent in size, they're thin, they're crispy. 

929
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,880
Nice colour. 

930
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Just a little bit underwhipped cream. 

931
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,040
They're all pretty much the same length. 

932
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,760
- These look rather nice. 
- These look all right, actually. 
- Mmm-hmm. 

933
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,920
They're all consistent in their shape, aren't they? 

934
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,440
- It's got a good crunch. 
- A beautiful crunch, can you hear them? 

935
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,920
- Size of them.
- Mmm. 

936
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,840
- Are you going to tuck in, Mary? 
- I am, can't resist that. 

937
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,080
Delicious. 

938
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,760
Oh, you can hear how crunchy they are. 

939
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,480
Really nice. 

940
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,000
Mmm. 

941
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,560
I think this was a great technical challenge to see 

942
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,840
how they cope with oven work. 

943
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,160
It all boils down to oven work. 

944
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,040
But in all these challenges what we are seeking is every item 

945
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,760
to be uniform and we had all different sizes of brandy snaps 

946
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,840
and they should be exactly the same size. 

947
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,280
Do you know what makes that a great brandy snap? 

948
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,440
Tell me. 

949
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,120
The texture, the snap, the taste of the ginger, 

950
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,400
and that beautiful caramel flavour it leaves in your mouth, 

951
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,920
and all washed down with a load of cream. You can't go wrong. 

952
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,840
It is something for a special occasion, isn't it? 

953
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,800
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday 

954
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,520
- and possibly Sunday. 
- As well.
- But yes. 

955
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,640
Next time on the Great British Bake Off: Masterclass... 

956
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,320
Mary and I will give you foolproof recipes for four more bake off challenges. 

957
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,560
We'll be showing you my ultimate miniature pork pie - 

958
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,280
a combination of crisp hot water crust pastry 

959
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,440
and a succulent meat and quail's egg filling. 

960
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,640
Take a spoonful of the mixture, drop it into the bottom, 

961
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,560
push down the bottom, build up a bit of the mix round the side, 

962
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,040
that is where the quail's egg is going to sit. 

963
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,360
Mary Berry's decadent extravaganza, 

964
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,880
the moist, light and perfectly rolled chocolate roulade. 

965
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,160
I'm going to beat in a little bit of the egg white. 

966
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,120
I'm not going to fold the whole lot in at once, 

967
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,640
because if you do that it'll be streaky. 

968
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,240
My soft, buttery iced fingers filled with the lightest whipped cream 

969
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,560
and strawberry jam. 

970
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,440
You can see you've still got some residue flour that needs picking up. 

971
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,440
THAT'S when you put the rest of the water in. 

972
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,000
And finally, Mary 'queen of desserts' ultimate cake, 

973
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,960
sophisticated, bittersweet, dense and rich, 

974
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,720
it's the Sachertorte. 

975
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,320
It will naturally melt, it won't curdle, it won't separate, 

976
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,120
it's quite easy to do, but you must do it off the heat. 

977
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,120
I hope the people that watch the programme are inspired to actually start baking at home. 

978
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,000
If you follow these masterclasses to the letter without deviation, 

979
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,040
you will end up with fantastic bakes. 

980
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,560
I'm hoping that when people have seen these masterclasses, 

981
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:11,080
they will be inspired to have a go at home and produce really good results 

982
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,640
cos I've tried to go into every detail so they should get success every time.
