1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,320
- 'Ten people remain in The Great British Bake Off.'
- If I couldn't bake, I don't know what I'd do.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,560
- I'm doing it as well as I can. 
- Just doing it this far is great.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,000
- 'Last time...'
- Please!
- '..they pushed themselves to the limit.'

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,960
- You can win it one week and be knocked out the next.
- 'With pastry.'

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,440
- It looks a mess.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- OK. 
- '19-year-old Jason was crowned Star Baker.'

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,880
- The salmon flavour is spectacular. 
- 'But for the first time in the Bake Off, Jo struggled.'

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,080
- Sorry.
- 'And yet again...'
- They're knackered, absolutely knackered.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,680
- '..Rob came close to leaving the competition.'
- You're lucky. 
- You haven't seen the best of me.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,280
- 'This week, it's bread.'
- I'm looking forward to a decent loaf.
- I'm looking forward to giving you one.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,720
- 'Paul's lifelong obsession.' 
- Someone hasn't followed my recipe. 
- 'And some bakers' nightmare.'

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,200
Ian! Ian, Ian!

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,920
- 'Who will rise to the occasion?' 
- I look mental just staring at the oven.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,880
- 'And prove they have what it takes?' 
- Does that sound hollow? 
- I really don't know.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,640
'To win The Great British Bake Off.'

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,200
You know what? This is one thing I might have up on you.

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,320
This week, our bakers will be tackling bread.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
So dust down your baps. This is Paul's watch.

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,360
'The ten remaining bakers are about to face three increasingly complex challenges over the next two days,

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,200
'after which, whoever falls short will have to leave the Bake Off.'

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,360
Good morning and welcome back, bakers. Now be afraid, be very afraid

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,400
because you're on Paul's patch as this week, it's bread week.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,960
Bakers, your signature challenge today is to create a flavoured loaf which is free-form.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,200
That means not baked in a tin.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,120
- You've got three-and-a-quarter hours.
- Tighten up the apron strings, wash your hands. On your marks...

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,240
- Get set... 
- BOTH: Bake!

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,280
This first challenge requires that the bakers create a loaf

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,720
which looks good, tastes better and features innovative and complementary flavours.

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,640
They have complete freedom with ingredients,

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,120
but as this must be a free-form loaf, the only thing they can't use is a tin.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,880
Some of them have not the skill and they've been practising like mad all last week.

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
Let's hope they achieve good results.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,640
Everybody who makes bread at home knows how tricky it can be.

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,680
You've got to make the dough, rise the dough and bake the dough.

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,720
Those three things they must do, each one they could fall down on.

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,840
The winner last year was the guy that made the best bread on the day,

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
so the consistency we're looking for is much higher than other weeks

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,920
because technically, this is harder to do.

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,120
I am feeling pretty relaxed. I've made this bread many times.

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
And it tastes fabulous.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,720
Mary-Anne has three university degrees, but now devotes most of her time to studying baking.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,960
Everything she's learnt has gone into her ambitious and totally original recipe

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,160
for a ploughman's loaf, featuring cheese, fresh onion and a bottle of beer.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,560
Imagine a ploughman out in the field taking his packed lunch.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
- This bread, an apple and a drink and you'd be set.
- You certainly would!

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
How are you getting the cheese in there?

46
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm doing big chunks of a nice, really strong Welsh cheddar,

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,560
so it doesn't disappear into the loaf when it cooks.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,800
- You do get a nugget of cheese. 
- So again a nice, robust, rustic dish from you.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,000
Successful, basic bread dough is a carefully measured combination of yeast, flour, water and salt.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,520
The bakers are free to add any other ingredients they wish at any stage.

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,360
And as usual, Holly is already aiming high.

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,240
The flavours are Parma ham and caramelised onions in one side

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,200
and then just chocolate and hazelnut in the other.

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,120
- In the same dough?
- Yes.

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Sweet and savoury at either end?

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,120
It's easy to take on a picnic. You've got enough to do with all the paraphernalia with babies.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,480
'Holly's obsession with home baking has forced her husband to build new shelves

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,040
'for all her recipe books and often she reads them in bed.

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,000
'Her signature sweet and savoury loaf is based on a complex brioche dough,

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,200
'made by adding eggs and milk to a basic bread dough.'

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,240
- The proof will be whether you take a mouthful and you get chocolate and onion.
- That would be a nightmare.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,360
- I prefer two separate things. 
- Yeah, me too.
- But in this category, she couldn't do two loaves.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,280
You asked for one loaf. If it doesn't work, you'll say, "I told you so."

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
- The silverback will attack. 
- Yes. Let's wait and see.

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
Kneading is one of the most critical elements of bread-making.

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,680
It stretches molecules of gluten in the dough.

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
If these are not forced to become elastic,

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,560
the dough will not rise and the loaf's structure will be tough and inedible.

69
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,320
A lot of it is having the strength to knead it.

70
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,240
But I use a mixer. It's a lot easier. There's no point in kneading it unless you want muscles.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,440
Urvashi has developed her own short cut.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,480
I've tried different ways of kneading and this one works for me,

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
so stick to it.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Mum of two and full-time marketing executive,

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Urvashi dreams of one day baking for her own delicatessen.

76
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
She aims to impress with her signature peppercorn loaf.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,680
It gets to this stage and you panic because you think, "It's sticking to the table!"

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,480
- Is there anyone you're thinking about when you're doing that? 
- I can name a few people, yeah.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,040
- Do you pretend that the dough is Paul's face?
- No.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,680
And you're just working your fists into his face?

81
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,360
I think, for me, if you use it as something that's horrible,

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
- you don't get quite so good a food. 
- Oh, really?

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,760
Climbing fanatic Ben also has a passion for musicals

84
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,200
and has performed in shows across London's West End.

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,400
He's hoping to dazzle the judges with his walnut, raisin and rosemary loaf.

86
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,880
It's a very nerve-wracking week. It's Paul's thing.

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,880
What I want to do is get something that he would find acceptable, I think is the goal of today.

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Hang on, hang on, hang on. Three o'clock, mate.

89
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,240
Look as if you know what you're doing. You do know what you're doing. Hi, Paul!

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,200
'With kneading complete, the dough must be proved.

91
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,280
'If left covered in a warm place,

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,120
'the yeast feeds on the flour, releasing bubbles of carbon dioxide, causing the dough to rise.

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,680
'Unless the bakers factor in enough time for their dough to prove to twice its original size,

94
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,720
'their loaf's crumb structure will be unacceptably tight.'

95
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,240
Bread takes long, but it's not a long time of doing stuff. It's just waiting for it to rise.

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,120
'For one of the bakers, this pause in the first challenge is welcome.'

97
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Ian! Ian, Ian!

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440
- This is the beginning of the Bake Off weekend.
- I know.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,040
When his partner Stephan fell ill ten years ago,

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,920
Ian quit his job to care for him and while at home, developed his talent and passion for baking.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,560
His signature bake is one of Stephan's favourites -

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,480
a courgette loaf flavoured with Caerphilly cheese and thyme.

103
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,320
- What's happened?
- I cut my finger when I was chopping my thyme very delicately.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
I cut the top of my finger. But I think I'm going to be OK.

105
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Will you have to do the whole challenge one-handed?

106
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,680
No, I'm hoping the bleeding will be stemmed enough.

107
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,320
- Do you like your elbow support? 
- It's lovely. I think I might ask for that permanently.

108
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,320
'The business of bread-making has always been one of Britain's most dangerous professions

109
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,360
'and working in a mill could seriously damage your health.'

110
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
Tom, I've heard that working in a mill is quite dangerous.

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,440
- Should I be wearing a protective suit?
- Not today, no.

112
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
But you could get mixed up in the machinery.

113
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,000
There is no emergency "stop" button here.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Medieval millers did occasionally lose legs or arms or even heads.

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,440
'And if you weren't mangled by the machinery, you could be crushed by the millstone itself.'

116
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,480
Some types of millstone were made not just of one piece of stone, but several smaller pieces of stone,

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,880
all held together by a steel band. If that band breaks,

118
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
then pieces of millstone would fly out in all directions.

119
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,200
- Seriously?
- We're talking about millstone missiles.
- Have you got your steel band in place?
- Yes. Trust me.

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,840
'Flying millstones and the risk of decapitation is just the beginning.'

121
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,480
This flour is the main danger facing us in this mill.

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,760
- Why is it dangerous? 
- In the right concentration in the air, flour dust can explode.

123
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,480
There would be no warning and the mill would be destroyed.

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
'And we're not just talking medieval mills.

125
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,480
'In 1965, a massive explosion tore through a mill in London's East End, costing the lives of four people.

126
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,560
'It turns out that flour is a lethal and explosive carbohydrate.'

127
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Mike, why is flour so combustible?

128
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,920
Because it's a carbohydrate

129
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,960
and contains carbon and hydrogen and oxygen

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,520
and that enables it to burn.

131
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Take me through how a mill actually explodes. What happens?

132
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,720
There's a lot of flour, very fine particles suspended in the atmosphere.

133
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,920
And if there's an ignition source like the millstones getting hot

134
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,400
or machinery getting hot, you have an explosive mixture.

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,120
'To test flour's flammability, Mike has created a replica mill,

136
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,360
'complete with a dusting of flour and a candle to supply the ignition.'

137
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,920
- Mike, much as I trust you, health and safety at all times...
- OK.

138
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,400
- I'm going to use these bellows to force some air...
- OK.

139
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,040
- ..into the tubing and up through the funnel.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Whoa!

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,520
Mike, that's, um... That's pretty impressive, Mike.

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,840
It seems to have melted your mill. That's amazing.

143
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,760
- So quick as well. 
- So quick, yes.
- Scary.

144
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,480
I felt that from back there. Seriously.

145
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,520
'Don't try this at home.

146
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,560
'The next time you bite into a sliced loaf, think of our early bread-makers.

147
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,520
'To produce our daily bread, they were dicing with danger.'

148
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,760
90 minutes to go in the signature bake.

149
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,480
I think it is rising, but I don't want to push my luck.

150
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,560
With their dough proving, most bakers have moved on to preparing any fillings

151
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,600
for their signature bake.

152
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,400
There's a lot of work, then there's a lull as you're waiting for it to prove.

153
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,120
That's what puts people off making bread. It's time-consuming, then often it comes out as a brick.

154
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,240
Yasmin works with her husband as a childminder, but has had jobs

155
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,960
from receptionist to poetry magazine editor and paramedic.

156
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,960
She hopes the diverse flavours in her North African-inspired loaf will impress.

157
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,120
- It's a white loaf, but I'm adding an Egyptian spice mix called dukkah to it.
- Delicious.

158
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,600
Is it salt, sesame seeds, coriander?

159
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,040
It's cumin, coriander, thyme, sesame seeds, almonds.

160
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I just put it on meat and pizzas.

161
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,560
You've roasted this because it's warm. And that makes the aroma. It's lovely. Hmm!

162
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,160
Once risen, bread dough must be knocked back,

163
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,400
a technique which disperses any large bubbles of carbon dioxide.

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,200
This is my favourite bit when it comes out and you see all the little bubbles popping everywhere.

165
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,840
Dough which hasn't been knocked back will produce bread of an uneven texture with tunnelling

166
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
and large air holes.

167
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,440
I'm adding green peppercorn. I don't want it to blow your mouth away.

168
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,120
I want it to be a subtle flavour.

169
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,280
Introducing any ingredients to a bread dough risks altering its delicate chemical balance.

170
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:59,240
- I hope it impresses them.
- Incorrect proportions of an acidic ingredient like onion can retard the yeast,

171
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,640
stopping any rise in its tracks.

172
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm intrigued because I've seen these neat little piles of cheese and neat little piles of fried onion.

173
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,760
They're for my tear-and-share cheese and onion loaf.

174
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm making little balls. It's got a cheese and onion package inside.

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,640
Hopefully, when they rise, they will stick together like a honeycomb shape.

176
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,680
When he isn't studying, 19-year-old Jason is a passionate member of his university's baking society.

177
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,200
His cheese and onion tear-and-share loaf will also feature a cheddar cheese crust.

178
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
The dough pieces are too spread apart on the tray.

179
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,960
I don't think they'll join together sufficiently. If you lift up one half, it'll collapse.

180
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,800
I think those balls will struggle to rise.

181
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,640
There's something so satisfying about bread. How old were you when you started baking bread?

182
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,680
I started when we lived in West Africa and I had to cook the bread

183
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,520
because the bread was awful, it was just like cotton wool.

184
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,480
Globe-trotting grandma and retired teacher Janet has worked in Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and India,

185
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,480
but her signature loaf is Swiss - a Zupfe loaf flavoured with Gruyere cheese.

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,280
- I was going to weigh it, but I'm so rubbish at dividing in numbers. 
- Into three?
- Into six.

187
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,240
A six-strand plait? I want to see this.

188
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,640
My friend in Switzerland makes this every Sunday.

189
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,160
When we used to go and stay, she used to turn out about four of these for breakfast.

190
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,680
- How are you going to do six? 
- Over two, under one, over two, then over two, under one, over two.

191
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm absolutely enraptured. I could watch this for hours.

192
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,640
Aw!

193
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,000
That's really impressive. I like that plait.

194
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,360
Jo has opted for a loaf that seems more straightforward.

195
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm just shaping it out into a rectangle,

196
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,960
so that I can put my fillings in it. You pull it out, rather than roll it.

197
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,360
I don't want to lose any air from it.

198
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,280
Jo has spent 20 years raising her three sons.

199
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,320
They persuaded their mum to enter the Bake Off, so she could do something for her,

200
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,320
but her mozzarella, ham and pepper Stromboli loaf is still all about her boys.

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,360
- Have you been working on this all week?
- I make this a lot cos Dylan loves it.

202
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,400
- He has it for packed lunch for school, so sometimes I'll make one the night before.
- Oh, lucky boy!

203
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,800
I used to have Wagon Wheels and a penny wafer if I was lucky.

204
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,080
'To reduce the risk of a filling inhibiting the bread's rise, the dough is proved for a second time.'

205
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,600
- It's a waiting game.
- It is, yeah.

206
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,800
- OK then...
- One hour to go. 
- Oh, gosh!

207
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,160
Without a tin to contain it, the re-risen dough must now be shaped before baking.

208
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,560
Oh, that's got a great wobble. It's like a deployed airbag.

209
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm looking forward to a decent loaf.

210
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm looking forward to giving you one.

211
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Dedicated foodie Rob lives in London and loves trying out new recipes on his friends.

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,240
He's created a rye and coriander seed loaf in the bid to redeem his reputation.

213
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,520
- How are you going to finish that? 
- With a bit of flour, then I'll slash it.
- What blade?

214
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm going to use a bread knife. I've tried using scalpels before, but haven't found anything sharp enough.

215
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,240
Scoring the loaf shapes it by controlling the direction in which it expands in the oven.

216
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,040
- I'm not a confident slasher. 
- Unless the cut is smooth, the bakers risk tearing their dough

217
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,760
- which could cause the loaf to collapse.
- It's a bit scary. You just want it to be right.

218
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,200
But you can never, never tell.

219
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,360
Adding water to the oven creates steam, keeping the crust soft at the beginning of the bake

220
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,200
- and allowing the loaf to rise more freely.
- Fingers crossed.

221
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,320
The steam will also dissolve the sugars on the dough crust.

222
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,960
- As the water evaporates, the sugars caramelise, leaving a glossy crust. 
- That's it. It's done.

223
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,680
I've done everything I can possibly do.

224
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm just going to have to hope now.

225
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,880
Leaving bread to bake too long risks a burnt crust and dry texture.

226
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,120
Too short and all you're left with is a wet, doughy disaster.

227
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,280
I look slightly mental just staring at the oven,

228
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,000
but it's seconds with this thing. It could just go.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,040
It won't win any beauty contests, but it's smelling really nice.

230
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,320
We've got an amazing selection. We've got herbs, spices, cheese, onions.

231
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,240
Different shapes, original methods. We couldn't have had a greater variety.

232
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah.

233
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,040
It should be done. I just don't want it to be under.

234
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,280
There's only one test for a well-baked loaf -

235
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,920
tapping its bottom.

236
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,400
Does that sound hollow to you? I don't know.

237
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,600
- What is it?
- It's like a rye.

238
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,160
It's quite tense. It's not like a cake where you can put a skewer in and know when it's cooked.

239
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,480
You've got to go on sound and I'm never entirely sure what a hollow sound sounds like.

240
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,720
It did not sound hollow, so I'll pop it back in.

241
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,480
TAPPING SOUNDS

242
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,000
OK, I hate to be a "pan" in the backside, but time is up, so stop baking now.

243
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,320
Done.

244
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,960
It's like the worst week in a way. Paul's such an expert in this area. It is pretty nerve-wracking.

245
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,600
It's judgment time.

246
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,640
- Hi, Jason.
- Hello.
- Look at this!

247
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,520
It's baked well. It's nice and soft.

248
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,720
I was a bit concerned that they weren't going to touch sufficient enough to be classed as a loaf.

249
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,920
It's a lovely texture, that, isn't it?

250
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Hmm. It's got a lovely flavour as well.

251
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,400
- I think you've done quite well, Jason.
- Quite well. Notice he can't say "really well".

252
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
That looks a fine-shaped loaf. Very bold, isn't it?

253
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
It is, yeah.

254
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,440
- It smells lovely.
- Have a smell.

255
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,160
- The coriander comes out very strongly.
- Lovely.

256
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,320
The flavours are excellent. I like that. I like that idea.

257
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,320
What's left with me is strong, strong rosemary.

258
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,400
- Overwhelmed totally by the rosemary.
- Really? I like the rosemary flavour in it.

259
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
- Then don't put the raisins and walnut in there.
- OK.

260
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,600
The shape and the seasoning are very good.

261
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,640
You've got nice flavours, but unfortunately, you've left the bottom unbaked.

262
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,360
You have a run of unbaked dough.

263
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
- You've got a lovely look on that bloomer.
- Thanks.

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,760
I like the crust on that. I'd like more salt in it. Would you?

265
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,360
- Yeah.
- I normally put five grams of salt in a 500 gram of flour loaf.

266
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Personally, I would use 10 grams for 500.

267
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,760
- Right.
- The texture's great, looks great. It's lacking with flavour.

268
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,120
It doesn't look very neat.

269
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,560
- No.
- But it works in so many ways because you haven't been afraid to put colour on it.

270
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,600
With bread sometimes it's a good thing not to be neat. It's nice to be informal.

271
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,880
- All the flavours are coming through. 
- Smashing crust.
- Really good.

272
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,320
- Thanks, Mary-Anne.
- Thank you.

273
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,640
It falls apart when it cuts.

274
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,920
- All this separation doesn't look very good.
- It's very tricky, doing this.

275
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,320
- You've got some great flavours going on in there, but it's slightly underbaked.
- OK.

276
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,280
The bake's excellent.

277
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,120
- The coriander is not coming through. 
- The coriander seeds aren't coming through.

278
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,280
- It's more the smell I think you get from the coriander.
- Yeah, but I'll expect to taste it as well.

279
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,080
The overall technical ability of making that loaf is very good.

280
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
- I hope you carry on in that vein. 
- Cheers.

281
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,960
Gosh, this is a whopper, isn't it?

282
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,000
That heavy weight is to do with that.

283
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,840
It's not proved and baked enough. You can see how wet it is. A courgette will always do that.

284
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,640
It will introduce moisture. It will never take it away.

285
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,520
- How much courgette? - About 250...

286
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,440
- That's what's making it... 
- It'll never bake.

287
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
It looks a great loaf. It's got a nice structure.

288
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,240
You've got the onion marmalade really well cooked. There are still the pieces there. It's a lovely texture.

289
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,920
You've got some nice flavours in there. You've done well.

290
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,760
Phew!

291
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,360
Holly, Jason, Mary-Anne and Yasmin have already staked their claim to become this week's Star Baker.

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:47,000
But Ian, Jo, Janet and Urvashi must improve over the next two challenges.

293
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,240
It's a bit ironic that I started out to create a loaf that wasn't bland and it ended up being quite bland,

294
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,280
so I'm a bit disappointed.

295
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,600
I've made it loads of times before.

296
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,160
I like it, my friends and family like it, so it won't put me off making it, but I was disappointed.

297
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,480
Paul was impressed. I thought it was going to work, so I am happy!

298
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,600
Be it a white, sliced loaf or a crusty cob,

299
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,160
British bread has classically been reliant on wheat.

300
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Not so over the Irish Sea where their first bread was based on an entirely different crop.

301
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,880
"May the enemies of Ireland never eat bread, nor drink whiskey,

302
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,280
"but be tormented with itching without benefit of scratching."

303
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,120
That St Patrick's Day toast shows the Irish love of a good loaf,

304
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,160
but in the 19th century, it took a different form.

305
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,680
The wet Irish climate wasn't great for growing wheat,

306
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,000
so the working classes made their bread with the only crop they had.

307
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,360
The potato grew very well in Irish soils

308
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,040
and even on a small plot of land, you got excellent returns.

309
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,080
One acre would support a family for one year.

310
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,120
It's not surprising that Irish people started making potato breads.

311
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,520
The easiest one to make, and it tastes really good, is potato bread made from mashed potatoes,

312
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,960
a bit of flour, salt and so on,

313
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,200
mixed together and baked over the fire on a griddle.

314
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,240
For the underclasses, the potato was the only ingredient in a very monotonous diet.

315
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,480
The estimates are that an average person was consuming 14 pounds of potatoes per day.

316
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,240
In 1845, disaster struck. Over a warm, rainy summer, potato blight swept the country.

317
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,280
Not only did absentee English landlords prohibit farmers from varying their crop,

318
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,560
the British government failed to realise how serious the famine was and swathes of crops were destroyed.

319
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,000
In Ireland, close to three million people were without their main source of food.

320
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
Up to about a million people died of disease and malnutrition

321
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
and another million emigrated.

322
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,680
Together, that exodus represented about a quarter of the population.

323
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,800
Times remained desperate until the early 1850s

324
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,960
when hard wheat and bicarbonate of soda were shipped in from across the Atlantic,

325
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
giving birth to Irish soda bread.

326
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Soda bread was cheap, easy and quick to make, instantly becoming an Irish favourite.

327
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,120
Even today, traditional bakeries produce up to 10,000 loaves a week, either griddled or baked.

328
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
I think we're the only region within the British Isles

329
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,440
that has an ethnic range of breads that people buy on a daily basis.

330
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,760
I would have said that ten years ago soda farls would have declined. In fact, the opposite has happened.

331
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,240
It's so important, I feel, to keep that tradition

332
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,080
and try and get another generation of people wanting to eat it, and we should be proud of it.

333
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,400
Unique, tasty, popular - the bread of Ireland has quite rightly become a national icon.

334
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,400
'The bakers' next challenge involves a bread from another part of Europe.

335
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,520
'It's become wildly popular in this country despite how difficult it is to bake correctly.'

336
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,040
Bakers, now it's time for the technical challenge.

337
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,640
As ever, this is judged blind,

338
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,200
so we're going to ask Paul and Mary to leave while the baking commences.

339
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,040
And breathe easy! I can now reveal to you bakers that your technical recipe for this challenge

340
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,840
is...focaccia,

341
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,360
and to add a little bit of pressure into the mix,

342
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,080
you will be working with Paul Hollywood's own recipe.

343
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,280
We're looking for the perfect focaccia and you've got three and a half hours in which to bake it.

344
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,960
- So on your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

345
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,360
Focaccia is an Italian flat bread which originated in Ancient Rome

346
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,480
where it was originally baked in the ashes of the fireplace.

347
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,960
All the bakers have access to identical, but unmeasured ingredients.

348
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,440
But certain details from Paul's recipe are missing.

349
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,960
And they will need all of their baking instinct to fill the gaps.

350
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,320
The crumb structure in a focaccia should look just like that.

351
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,360
It's a quite open structure with big holes, small holes, big holes, small holes.

352
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,400
English bread has very tight, small air holes.

353
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,320
This recipe has lots of water in it, causing this irregular crumb.

354
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,920
To start off with, you put three-quarters of the water into the dough,

355
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,840
then mix that up in the bowl, then you can introduce the rest of the water, a little at a time.

356
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,760
If they add all the water at the same time, it'll turn into a mush.

357
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,120
- That's strange. 
- It is weird, isn't it?
- Oh, gosh.

358
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,720
I've got no idea if this is right.

359
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,400
- Will this make bread?
- Are you sure you should be adding more, Jason?

360
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,080
I've got to try and salvage what I can.

361
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,520
HE LAUGHS

362
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,560
I'll just go with it and see what happens.

363
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,120
Adding flour is risky. It can transform the wet, batter-like dough of a good focaccia

364
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,920
into a conventional bread mix.

365
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,840
Every drop of water should be used.

366
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,880
- I've kind of done that. 
- So you are way... Have you got any more water to add?

367
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,080
I've got a bit there, but the dough was wetter than I would have liked.

368
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,120
"Tuck the sides of the dough into the centre. Turn the bowl 90 degrees."

369
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,520
You've got to have faith in the recipe.

370
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,800
The wet dough must be stretched to activate the gluten.

371
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,360
Only oil should be used to stop it from sticking.

372
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,280
- Can I just grab a bit of flour? 
- Yeah. Sorry.

373
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,720
The more the dough is worked, the larger the air holes in the bread.

374
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,000
Obviously, Paul knows what he's doing, but at the minute... I really don't know.

375
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,840
Next, the dough must be proved for the yeast to release bubbles of carbon dioxide.

376
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,400
It's during this stage that the amount of water used

377
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,920
will determine just how irregular those bubbles are.

378
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,200
It's massive. Look!

379
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,160
I don't know if it's supposed to look like that.

380
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,200
CLATTER Oh!

381
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,000
Oops!

382
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
It's flattened a bit.

383
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,680
It's entirely up to the bakers when to stop proving.

384
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,480
I think that's probably fine.

385
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Next, the dough must be flattened...

386
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
and dimpled.

387
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,080
I'm concerned because it says, "Flatten the dough on the tray and add dimples." But it's so wet still.

388
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
90 minutes to go.

389
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,160
Timing is now crucial.

390
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,680
During the second proving, the bakers need the dough to double in size again.

391
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,840
But they still need enough remaining time to bake the focaccia correctly.

392
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,120
- It's all right. - Let me see yours.

393
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,160
If it hasn't risen, I've just wasted an hour.

394
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,960
I don't think it's number one, but you never know.

395
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,640
Ladies and gentlemen, you've got 30 minutes to go before your breads must be finished.

396
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,960
The last two ingredients are olive oil...

397
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm trying to drizzle, rather than have a flood.

398
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,040
- ..and salt. 
- I feel like a chef doing that.

399
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,720
These provide colour and a crisp texture as the focaccia bakes in the oven.

400
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,560
- Fingers crossed.
- No exact oven time has been specified. The bakers are on their own.

401
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,120
I think it's going to be really good because you can see the dimples. Mine's just completely flat.

402
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, this looks good, you know.

403
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,560
OK, that's one minute, please.

404
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,320
- You've got to be proud of that. - I am quite proud of that.

405
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,480
Oh, yes, Janet, yes!

406
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,640
Yeah, right(!)

407
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,120
Bakers, please bring your focaccia up towards the gingham altar to be judged.

408
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,480
The technical bake is judged blind.

409
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,520
Paul and Mary will have no idea whose focaccia is whose.

410
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,000
They're more similar than I thought they would be.

411
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,480
By slicing each focaccia, Paul and Mary will be able to discover

412
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,520
who has achieved the all-important, irregular crumb structure.

413
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,440
- We'll try this one, Mary.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,640
Someone's not been following my recipe. There's too much flour in there.

415
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,280
Those are all even, little tiny holes in that,

416
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,720
not the different sized aeration.

417
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,920
Someone's thought, "Paul's made a mistake here. I don't think I'll add all the water."

418
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,960
The flavour of that one is all right, but there's not enough water in there.

419
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,120
Or they added too much flour and kneaded it.

420
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,440
This has got a crisper top and the aeration is uneven.

421
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,560
- Again too much flour. 
- Would you say that that is when they've been kneading it?

422
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,080
- They've added more flour as they thought it was too wet.
- Yeah.

423
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,240
It's the same with that one. It's a dry crumb. It's not wet enough.

424
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,000
This one's quite interesting, actually.

425
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,160
This one looks a bit better.

426
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,400
- You see the strata on that one? 
- Yes, it's springy.

427
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,760
- And it tastes good. 
- This is a wet dough.

428
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,320
Dimples would be good inside it as well, but don't just go... Put them in right the way down.

429
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,320
That's not bad though.

430
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,640
It's got a nice crust.

431
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,600
Mm-hm.

432
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,040
That's bread-like again.

433
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,760
- This one's a bit bready again. 
- It has a nice crust, though.

434
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,240
Hmm.

435
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,280
Paul and Mary must now rank the focaccias from worst to best.

436
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,240
- I'm in total agreement. 
- The person in last place is...

437
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,720
this one. That's yours.

438
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,200
- Do you understand why?
- Yeah, not enough water, too much flour.

439
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,760
Number nine, this one here.

440
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:41,040
When you look at that strata, it's not irregular enough. It's quite dry. It shouldn't be like that.

441
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,760
- For the third technical bake in a row, Janet finishes in the same position.
- Always number eight!

442
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,640
Followed by Jason in seventh place, Holly in sixth, Mary-Anne in fifth

443
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,520
and Rob just beaten by Ben in the battle for third.

444
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,160
- Number two.
- Very good.

445
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,520
- And number one is this. 
- APPLAUSE

446
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:09,320
- She's back!
- That strata, these massive air holes you hit every now and again are great.

447
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:15,760
That's really nice. That's one of the best ones by far and away I've seen for quite a while. Well done.

448
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,600
APPLAUSE

449
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,240
Obviously, that's how Paul wanted it to come out

450
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,600
and that was the recipe, so thank you to the bread god. Is that Paul?

451
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,120
I can't tell you what made me deviate from the recipe.

452
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,400
I've got to put it behind me and crack on and do the best I can in the next challenge.

453
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,440
If I spoke to my husband, he would say, "You're there, you're good at this, you know you're good at this.

454
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,200
"You just need to forget about what he said and just focus on what you need to do."

455
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,840
'There's just one final bread challenge left for the bakers to impress the judges.'

456
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,720
- Who's in the running for Star Baker? 
- I suppose it's Jo.

457
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,760
- I think Holly and Yasmin. 
- Who's in the danger zone?

458
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,360
- Ian and also Urvashi.
- I think Janet's got to be in there as well.

459
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,120
The challenge that they've got coming is extremely difficult and this really will sort them out.

460
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,200
We'll ask you to do something a little bit different for the showstopper. It's a two-part bake.

461
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,160
We'll ask you for this first part to make a display bread basket.

462
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,280
For the second part, we need you to fill that display bread basket with 24 rolls.

463
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
Sweet or savoury and up to two varieties.

464
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,120
You've got five hours on the clock.

465
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,280
- On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

466
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,720
'This final challenge is the ultimate test of planning, timing and precision.

467
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,960
'Individual rolls require even greater accuracy when it comes to proving,

468
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,320
'flavouring and baking.'

469
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,120
If I know I've done the best I possibly can, I'll be fine.

470
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,160
Urvashi's hopes of staying in the Bake Off rest on her chilli and halloumi rolls

471
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,600
and her lemon and coriander mini loaves.

472
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:13,120
- What other rolls are you doing? 
- Lemon and coriander baguettinis, so little baguettes.

473
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,240
- Baguettinis! 
- I like that word - "baguettini".

474
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,040
- Is that your word?
- Yeah.
- Very good.

475
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,040
- They should be quite different. - I hope so.

476
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm back in the zone. Once you start bread making, it's quite relaxing.

477
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,000
Survival for Ian depends on his walnut and raisin rolls and cracked wheat logs.

478
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,560
- Nervous about not being wet enough. - Doesn't feel wet.

479
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,160
- Can you add it now? 
- You can, but it's a nightmare.

480
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,880
What you're best off doing when you make doughs with additional flavour is to develop the dough first,

481
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,160
then after it's been resting for at least an hour, add your ingredient.

482
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,320
For the third Showstopper challenge in a row, Mary-Anne is experimenting.

483
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,560
I was reading a document I'd got saved on my computer by Eliza Acton.

484
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,000
She used to bake in earthenware pots.

485
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,640
I thought that sounds quite a nice idea.

486
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,880
I presume the clay gets hot and gives a nice crust.

487
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
Her herb and walnut flowerpot breads are just the start.

488
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,480
For dessert, there's chocolate and fresh chilli rolls.

489
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,960
It's chocolate dough with chocolate chips.

490
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,800
The overall flavour is chocolate, but there's a little afterglow of chilli.

491
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,000
- I think it works really well. Some of those will disappear. You'll find them in here.
- OK! Bye.

492
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,200
I think I am in control today.

493
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I've written everything down, I've been doing the timing's again. I'm organised and hopefully OK.

494
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,280
It is yet again another ambitious Showstopper for Rob

495
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,080
with blueberry brioche buns and rolls featuring poppy seeds and fresh lemon.

496
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,720
Have you put any lemon juice in or just the rind?

497
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,080
It hasn't got salt! Em, I've put...

498
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,320
- seven lemon rinds and one-and-a-half juice.
- Wow.
- No salt in this dough?

499
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,360
I always add it in in the end. Do the dough and then knead it for, say, eight minutes

500
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,080
- and then the last two minutes, put the salt in.
- Be really careful.

501
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,880
You'll never get salt distributed enough in the dough by hand then.

502
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,040
That's been salted now? Still bland.

503
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,240
Rip a bit of dough out.

504
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,280
- Yeah.
- Don't eat it!

505
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,040
- I just did.
- Don't eat it! Can you taste salt?

506
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,880
- No.
- Can you taste salt? 
- I swallowed it too quickly.

507
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,520
- You're not meant to swallow it. 
- I know.
- The best way is to dilute the salt in water

508
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,640
and then put it in your dough. More liquid makes it softer, which is good, and it distributes better.

509
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,640
Consistency of size and shape is preoccupying some bakers more than others.

510
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,720
I am just doing my stilton and walnut rolls.

511
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,240
And I'm weighing individually the cheese that goes in, which is just a bit nuts, actually.

512
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,040
But it's got to be done to make sure you get the right amount in each one.

513
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,920
I'm guessing the amount of onion and sage to put in. It's a bit here or there.

514
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,560
I want every single roll to be, um, kind of the exact same shape.

515
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,200
And so I'm weighing out the dough.

516
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,440
I hate all this weighing. 12. Four 12s is 48. Five 12s is 40...

517
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,280
Uh!

518
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,600
Three hours to go in the final challenge.

519
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,200
One of the best things about bread is you can apply so many different creative ideas to one basic dough.

520
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,840
Through the centuries, every UK region had its own bread recipe, especially the Scots,

521
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,600
who even formulated one to sustain their fishermen at sea.

522
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,040
Scotland's fishing industry played a pivotal role in the economy, but an army marches on its stomach

523
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,200
and the creation of a unique bread roll in the 19th century helped to ensure its continuing success.

524
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,240
Fishermen needed high-energy,

525
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,040
long-lasting food for the days at sea. They called it ship's biscuit.

526
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,280
They were very hard and dry because they were basically flower and water and made to last for many weeks.

527
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,160
They used to refer to it as hardtack because these were hard as rocks and utterly tasteless.

528
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
No Scotsman will put up with that.

529
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,400
In the 1880s, the fishing industry of Aberdeenshire expanded rapidly

530
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,160
as the numbers of herring boomed. At its peak, 40,000 people worked in Scotland's fishing industry

531
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,800
and around 7,000 boats filled with hungry fishermen were setting sail.

532
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,760
According to Aberdonian legend, a local fisherman approached a baker

533
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,200
and asked him to create something less hard and dry.

534
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,240
What the baker did was take a lump of bread dough, he added some fat, and then he kneaded it.

535
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,600
The result was a high-fat, salty, croissant-like bread roll that would last much longer

536
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,080
than a conventional roll. The Aberdeen buttery was born.

537
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:24,280
The high fat content, crucial to the success of the buttery, was directly linked to one of Aberdeen's

538
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,560
- most famous exports. 
- In the 1880s in Aberdeen,

539
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,120
there were lots of butchers. In their shops was dripping - ideal cheap fat that was readily available

540
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,320
for the buttery. The high fat meant it kept better and tasted better, whether one day old or three weeks.

541
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,880
The buttery was an instant hit. Its popularity soon extended beyond the fishing fleet,

542
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,360
gaining official recognition when it entered the Scottish dictionary in 1899.

543
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,000
And it continues to be a firm favourite amongst the fishermen during their time at sea.

544
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,320
It's got a lot of energy. You're always hungry, constantly.

545
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,360
All the fishing boats still eat them.

546
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,600
It's passed on, generation to generation. Folk like them.

547
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,640
With the average baker selling over 600 butteries a day,

548
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,920
the unique high-fat bread roll remains as popular as it was over 100 years ago.

549
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
They look really pretty.

550
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,640
With two hours to go, the rolls are ready to come out of the oven,

551
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,680
- but not all have gone according to plan.
- They're meant to have risen more. I think the yeast died.

552
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,880
- They should be double the size. 
- A number of factors can affect this,

553
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
but the key addition to be wary of is salt.

554
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,280
When mixing it with yeast and flour, it's crucial that the salt and yeast do not mix as salt kills yeast.

555
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,960
The bakers must now turn their attention to their display baskets.

556
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,080
These can be made with a non-edible salt dough or an edible bread dough.

557
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:13,160
- I've made this three times at home. I'm just hoping it's neat enough and it works today.
- What are you doing?

558
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,800
Basically, there's a criss-cross, then circles and these will go in and out of them.

559
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,320
- Latticed within that?
- Yeah.

560
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,840
Hold your hands out.

561
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,880
Oh, no, no, no! We need to do some work on this.

562
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,520
I need some mantra, to workshop. Would an expressive dance help?

563
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,720
- I need to just find a way of calming...
- Calming me down.
- Calm the central nervous system down.

564
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,280
- Are you doing a round basket? 
- On this thing.

565
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,720
I hope to have two ropes there.

566
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,560
And two ropes there. And in-between have three ears of corn that come down from the centre.

567
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,360
- I've got a pair of scissors! - It's totally different.

568
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,480
It's Planet Janet, Mary.

569
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,320
Janet is the only baker using a tricky wholemeal dough basket

570
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,960
to go with her apple and walnut granary rolls and her sage and red onion cottage rolls.

571
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,040
The basket is my only concern.

572
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,560
In wholemeal flour, the gluten level's lower,

573
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,840
which means the glue can break.

574
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,280
- So this is the triumphant wreath that goes atop the basket? 
- It'll be stuck over the top.

575
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,920
This is great. Is this a heavy salt crust?

576
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,560
- It's very, very salted to keep it together.
- It'll get a colour on it? 
- No, it doesn't colour.

577
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,600
- Will I be criticised for that? Probably.
- It's best not to wonder.

578
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,000
Best to say everything will be criticised and then not to worry!

579
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,360
- Wow!
- Hello.

580
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,400
- That looks like a hat to go to Ascot!
- Yasmin's intricate basket will be filled with pesto bread

581
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,440
and coconut rolls.

582
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,320
- Is this a salt dough?
- It is. I've made it twice. I made it with bread flour

583
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,360
and I could tell it was much stiffer because it's a stronger flour.

584
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,720
- I've gone back to plain flour. 
- Why?
- Because it was really stiff

585
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,400
- and not pliable at all. 
- Just add more water. 
- ..I like it like this.

586
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,240
- Yeah, she wants to do it.
- You prefer plain flour?
- This is one thing I might have up on you.

587
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,280
15 years of childcare teaches you something about salt dough.

588
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,880
- Play-Doh! 
- She's laying down the gauntlet.

589
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,240
When I look at that basket, I'm not seeing overall master plan. What's the end goal?

590
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,360
- I thought big and chunky actually looks more like bread.
- Yeah. 
- And looks like a bread basket,

591
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:50,040
which I figure is what they want. But I just want to get it in and started, then it holds its shape.

592
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,880
The baskets are first baked at a low temperature so the dough hardens.

593
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,440
After the initial bake, the basket should be solid and free-standing when the mould is removed.

594
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,080
Whoa! Is that Janet's?

595
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,240
That's amazing!

596
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,600
Take a look at it - it's collapsing.

597
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:20,560
I've got to try to put this piece on the top and put it back in the oven.

598
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,040
Just say a prayer for me.

599
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,600
OK, that's 10 minutes remaining, everyone. Just 10 minutes.

600
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:35,640
Time may be running out, but remove the baskets too soon and they might not be strong enough for the rolls.

601
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,960
Em...

602
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,440
It's not as elegant or as lovely as I'd like it, but hopefully with a nice egg wash

603
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,200
it'll look like bread.

604
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,080
- Now what are those shapes there? 
- Little duckies.
- Of course!

605
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,120
Yes. So I'm hoping if my bread rolls aren't any good,

606
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,680
my strategy is to create a diversion. Baking for survival, you know?

607
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,360
I could be going out. All you can do is get in here and do your best.

608
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,760
The whole thing's collapsed. I'm very disappointed.

609
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,920
I don't know what I can do now. It's just gone completely.

610
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,120
Don't worry. You see, these things are sent to try us.

611
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,960
This basket is a thing of great beauty. Or do I wear it as a hat?

612
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,040
It's like trying to make a jigsaw with no picture to go with it.

613
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,240
I'm very sad, really.

614
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,240
Some of these baskets are causing great trouble. They do need a different skill to make them.

615
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,560
It's danger zone for a few people. You've got a few of them now.

616
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,920
OK, that's one minute, everybody. One minute remaining.

617
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,520
Ladies and gentlemen, this is it. Please move away from your baskets and the breads therein.

618
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,560
Your time is up.

619
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,120
Mary and Paul must now judge each baker's offering individually before discussing who they think

620
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,160
should leave the Great British Bake Off.

621
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,200
Yasmin, please step forward.

622
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,880
Technically, your basket looks great. I was a bit worried about the amount of holes.

623
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,320
- What have we got here, Yasmin? 
- - Sweet bread with coconut. - Very light.

624
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:04,920
They're delicious. They taste great. It's the texture and the smell of that crumb. It's really nice.

625
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,560
- Are these the pesto?
- Yeah.

626
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,000
Pesto goes well with bread, I think.

627
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,840
- The bake is superb and the basket is really, really nice.
- Thank you.

628
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,560
- What do we have here, Ian?
- The little ones are walnut and raisin

629
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,800
and the back are cracked wheat.

630
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,320
This was a very tight texture when you were rolling it out.

631
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,880
And what have we got? A tight-textured roll.

632
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,640
And these little fellas, I'm not getting flavour.

633
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,280
The whole thing looks really posh, but the actual rolls when you get into them,

634
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,720
that ones very close and there's not much flavour to that.

635
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:55,560
The basket looks great. Technically, very good. It's very well done.

636
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,080
It tastes very good, but for some it might be too crusty.

637
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,720
- That's lovely. 
- It's beautiful.
- It's well-baked.

638
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:13,440
Looks good. I'd like to see them a little bit smaller, but technically all good.

639
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,000
Wow!

640
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,280
- Wow.
- You've nailed it.

641
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,760
- On visual appearance.
- Thank you. 
- It looks great.

642
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,880
Those chocolate ones I'm fascinated to taste.

643
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,320
The texture of it is moist, but it is, on your mouth, very, very dry.

644
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,040
I don't find it dry. I find it a lovely texture.

645
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,360
The only thing it needs is butter.

646
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,160
Did you design the basket to lurch forward like that?

647
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
I'd like to say yes, but no.

648
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,440
- It needed more support. 
- Remind us about them.

649
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,600
A lemon and poppy seed roll.

650
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,760
- Salt.
- Mm. As stated earlier, you need more salt.

651
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,480
All I'm getting is lemon. That's it.

652
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,760
These look sadly underproofed.

653
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,400
They stopped proofing. I don't know if the yeast died.

654
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,080
- They're absolutely solid. 
- I have to do my job.

655
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,240
- You've got too much salt in there. 
- Oh? OK.

656
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,400
The salt must have tipped in there.

657
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,640
I must have put salt instead of sugar. That's what's caused it.

658
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:33,320
The most important part of baking is weighing up. Mess up there, you mess up the whole line.

659
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,600
It's a great-looking basket and it's edible.

660
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:44,320
- Lots of flavours in there. 
- A little bit over-baked on the ones at the back that you've tucked in.

661
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,880
The basket looks a bit, em...

662
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,800
sparse.

663
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,720
- This is the lemon. 
- The lemon and coriander.

664
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,960
- The coriander doesn't come through. 
- Do you remember the recipe?

665
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,320
10 grams of salt... Actually, no, it would be 5 grams of salt.

666
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,360
- Yes, that's more like it! 
- Yes, it would be 5 grams of salt.

667
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,920
I toyed with putting more in, but I don't like a lot of salt in it.

668
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,720
I thought it was the right amount.

669
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,760
Salt is your killer every time.

670
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,600
- Chilli and halloumi. 
- These are chilli rolls to me. 
- Yeah, they are.

671
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,520
Halloumi will just get murdered.

672
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,560
- Last but not least... 
- Ah, Janet.

673
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,360
- Because of the gluten levels in wholemeal flour, it's not strong. 
- OK.
- That's part of why it collapsed.

674
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,000
- Sometimes disasters happen. - Yeah.

675
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,320
- Can you tell me what we've got here? 
- These are sage and onion.

676
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,920
- That's lovely and springy. 
- The bake is great, texture superb.

677
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,880
- Thank you.
- It needs a little bit more salt and a few more onions.

678
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,320
- Thanks, Janet.
- Thank you.

679
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,680
'They have to make the decision,'

680
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:07,640
but it should be on merit. And, you know, if I don't deserve to stay, that's fair enough.

681
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,280
By no means a bad judging. Whether it's enough to keep me in remains to be seen.

682
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:20,720
I would be slightly shocked if I went, but I did horrendously last week, so it wouldn't be unexpected.

683
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,520
I'm disappointed, I'm scared now still that I'll be the one to go home. He didn't like the flavours.

684
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,560
It does make me feel quite upset that I seem to be getting it right on the textures and construction

685
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,920
and not right on the flavour.

686
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,240
It's decision time for Paul and Mary.

687
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,320
Have you had a chance to consider who this week's Star Baker is?

688
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,240
I think that Yasmin has really pulled the stops out.

689
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,680
She's finished with a finale of beautiful rolls

690
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,360
- and a beautiful basket.
- Yes.

691
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:02,120
I also think Mary-Anne has done particularly well. She's got some fantastic ideas.

692
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,560
On the other end of the scale, who might be in danger?

693
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:14,280
I think Urvashi performed not so well. She tried so hard. She was dedicated and dying to do well,

694
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,360
- but she didn't quite get there. 
- She was second from bottom on the focaccia.

695
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,200
Rob has got to be in there again. After last week, I'm very aware of everything Rob does.

696
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,040
His basket today collapsed and the flavours were not good.

697
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,320
Ian's not had a brilliant weekend.

698
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,160
- Ian was bottom in his focaccia. His courgette bread... 
- So heavy, that loaf.

699
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,640
I remember lifting it and I thought, "What's in this?"

700
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,440
- And today we had two rolls which looked immaculate. 
- What a disappointment!

701
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,080
It's very important to us - as well as looking brilliant, it's got to taste good.

702
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,520
Janet with the disaster of her basket has got to be in there. She's been middling.

703
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,040
As we start reducing numbers down, you sharply become in the target zone.

704
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,680
The pool of danger zone people is quite large - four, potentially.

705
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,520
You have your choice between Rob, Janet, Urvashi and Ian.

706
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,600
- For me, it's very, very close.
- Mm.

707
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,000
- Do you think that two or one should go?
- Good question.

708
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,960
You know the score by now.

709
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:45,040
The judges have decided on their verdict. Let's start with the positive. The judges felt somebody

710
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,080
really, really impressed so the person we are giving the title of Star Baker to is...

711
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,720
Yasmin.

712
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,320
Well done, Yasmin. well done.

713
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,960
Sadly, of course, as you know,

714
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,320
there is a person or maybe two people...

715
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,600
that have failed to make the grade this week.

716
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,680
And those two people are...

717
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,600
Ian

718
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,240
and Urvashi.

719
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,040
We're very sorry to see you go.

720
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,160
Urvashi went because, sadly, she was very poor on her flavours.

721
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,960
She made a beautiful-looking loaf, but it didn't have enough flavours.

722
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,000
I'd have loved to stay in the competition a little bit longer, but it is a competition.

723
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,760
There's obviously things they've seen in other people, but not in me.

724
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,120
I've given it my best shot every week.

725
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,760
It has, in a funny kind of way, given me confidence, so overall I think I'm happy.

726
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Ian left today because he was ranked bottom in his signature loaf and bottom in the focaccia.

727
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,600
Today, although his breads did look OK, there was no substance to them. There was no flavour.

728
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,880
Yeah, I'm gutted and disappointed and I'm a bit sad,

729
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,240
but I will always have a love of baking.

730
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,880
If anything, this has added to it.

731
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,440
I can't believe I got Star Baker on the bread week. It's the ultimate accolade.

732
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,680
I am really proud of myself.

733
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,280
And I can't wait to tell my husband!

734
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,960
Losing two people has made it more real that it could be you at any point.

735
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,320
Only one person won't go through it - the winner.

736
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,200
Start practising in the morning.

737
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,360
- Next time...
- You never know. 
- ..it's the battle of the biscuits.

738
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,520
- Crunch time in the signature bake. 
- I can't bear to look.

739
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,560
'Mary Berry sets a tortuous technical challenge.' Brandy snaps!

740
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,720
It's hard to fill in. Oh, no. God.

741
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,320
And a Showstopper that features nearly 1,000 macaroons.

742
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,880
I personally think that's enough.

743
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,400
- Whose cookie is about to crumble? 
- Jason's doesn't work, really.

744
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:28,680
- And whose biscuits will bring an end to their Bake Off?
- The train is coming. I'll just let it hit me.
