1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,720
It's week two in our contest.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,600
Last week we were inadvertently served an upside-down cake on a floor tile.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,880
This week just 11 bakers remain.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,080
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,400
Thousands applied, but just the cream of Britain's best amateur bakers have been chosen for this,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,120
the ultimate test of their baking skills.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,280
I've been practising, everything seems to be on track, so I'm ready to go.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,000
Over the next seven weeks, their baking skills will be scrutinised and judged.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,440
I am definitely a perfectionist.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,800
This isn't just baking - I really want to win!

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,560
I'm a pretty emotional person. I get quite upset if things don't go well.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,760
Last week it was cakes...

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,200
My hands are shaking. It's getting to the really nervous part.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,880
And Holly was named star baker.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,440
- Stunning.
- Your piping is perfect.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
The stress of the Bake Off kitchen resulted in disaster for Rob.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
But it was Keith who failed to make the grade and was sent home.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
This week, the bakers tackle tarts.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
It looks all right, but...God - who knows?!

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
Very nice short pastry.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
- Oh, no...
- And the pressure of pastry is too much for some.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
- They won't come out. 
- These are not good enough.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,360
Just get it done! Stop messing around and get it in the oven.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,160
But who will last the distance to be crowned the winner of The Great British Bake Off?

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,080
Please, please!

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,760
It's week two in the search for Britain's best amateur baker, and over the next two days

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,520
the bakers will face three increasingly complicated challenges.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,800
They will be quaking in their aprons as we speak,

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,480
because this week it's all about tarts - isn't it, Sue?

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,400
- Why are you looking at me? 
- Don't know.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Tomorrow, one will be crowned this week's star baker.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,880
And someone will have to leave The Great British Bake Off.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Now, your first challenge this weekend is the signature bake,

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,800
and this one I'd like to think of as Lorraine's Revenge, because it's quiche time.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,200
You've got two hours to prepare a savoury quiche, encased in your choice of shortcrust pastry.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,360
You'll present your well turned-out quiches to Mary and Paul, who will be looking for

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,800
good ingredients, a nice, smooth egg filling, and most important of all, a well-baked pastry case.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,640
No soggy bottoms allowed in this tent!

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,800
On your marks...get set...bake!

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,280
A quiche is a savoury tart combining various ingredients with a custard filling

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,800
thickened with eggs, and baked in an open-topped pastry shell.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,040
The signature challenge requires the bakers to create an original recipe

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,760
and produce a quiche of any flavour or size.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,760
It must showcase their creativity and impress the judges -

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
master baker Paul Hollywood,

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
and Mary Berry, renowned author of over 60 cookery books.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
First of all I'm looking for a good pastry case, evenly baked -

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,040
even underneath it should be nice and brown and crisp.

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,400
For me, the perfect quiche has to marry up the flavours in the base

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,160
with the flavours in the filling.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,240
One thing I can't abide is having too many things going on inside,

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,600
too many things going on in the actual pastry -

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
that is a recipe for disaster.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,680
The bakers begin by making their shortcrust pastry.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Shortcrust is the perfect pastry for tarts, as it's robust and

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,080
doesn't rise in the oven, creating a perfect case to hold a filling.

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,160
Pastry can be a cruel mistress if you don't treat her well.

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,800
I don't actually like quiche so this is a particular challenge for me.

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,040
Ian is a self-taught baker who loves to cook with fresh local produce.

60
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
He's looking to pack a punch with his stilton,

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,080
spinach and new potato quiche.

62
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,680
It's quite a manly quiche.

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
Now, surely that is a contradiction in terms, a manly quiche.

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,760
You need to embrace the femininity.

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,560
- No, I'm doing a walnut pastry with a bit of paprika in it, so... 
- So you're trying to butch it up.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm trying to butch it up a bit, so it's quite a manly quiche if that's possible.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,960
Shortcrust pastry is made with three basic ingredients -

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,000
plain flour, liquid and fat, which can be either butter, lard or a mixture of both.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,680
One of the tricks with pastry at this stage is not to overwork it,

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
or it starts to go a bit gluteny and a bit tart.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Gluten is created when water and flour particles meet.

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,760
It's needed to hold the pastry together - but too much of it, and the pastry will become tough.

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,640
Working with pastry is actually quite tricky.

74
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,920
If you underwork pastry, it crumbles, it doesn't hold together.

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,600
If you overwork it, it goes like rubber. They have to get it perfect.

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Just getting the pastry started, it's coming together nicely.

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Tent's nice and cold, so nothing's melting yet.

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,880
Simon, dad of two and the family cook,

79
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,320
is making a dill-flavoured shortcrust pastry case

80
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,200
for his smoked haddock and watercress quiche.

81
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,560
Feeling a lot more comfortable - securing a place in the second round, that's put my confidence up,

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,080
so...just got to turn out a good quiche today and I think I'll be a lot happier.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,320
- Holly, Holly...
- Hello.

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,240
- How are you?
- Good. It's all about the green today, isn't it?

85
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
- It's all about the green. 
- Green top...

86
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, off the back of your success last week, how are you going to impress us now?

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,240
I'm going to be making a pesto... I guess a pesto-inspired quiche.

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,280
You've got a forest of basil over there.

89
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,360
I'm not using the stalks, so to get 200g of basil leaves...

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,200
I think it's a shame - it's very expensive not to use the stalks,

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,880
and if you chop it terribly finely, nobody would know.

92
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
OK, so you've kept it basic.

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,480
I mean, good luck. It is simple, but baked well... Good luck.

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,880
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Holly. I like pesto.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,480
But I mean a pesto quiche, mmm...

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Is it good enough? Is it going to give the flavour?

97
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,960
It will be if she's got a good proportion of cheese with it.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
I sense a bit of worry there.

99
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,800
25 minutes into the challenge. With their pastries made and rolled out,

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,760
the bakers begin to line their tins.

101
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,720
My biggest concern is that my pastry will have a soggy bottom.

102
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,280
If I blind bake it long enough, it should be OK...I'm hoping.

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,320
Blind baking is the term used for baking a crust before filling.

104
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,560
Bakers first prick the base to prevent air pockets from forming,

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,160
and then the base is covered with foil or baking parchment,

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,560
and weights added to prevent the case sides from shrinking.

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,520
I always use kidney beans because that's what my mother used.

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,840
And they're cheaper than baking beans as well.

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,480
So you've got your beans on top?

110
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,680
- I've got the beans on top.
- Good. 
- I hope they're enough to weigh it down, and it doesn't balloon out.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,920
Janet is well known in her local area for her baking.

112
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,120
Her pastry case is flavoured with cheddar cheese

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,320
and filled with mixed vegetables.

114
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,040
Round our way we grow asparagus. I just thought it would be light and

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,720
fresh - hoping people feel the taste of summer.

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,080
With the pastries in the oven, the home bakers get on with making their fillings.

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,600
Beautiful.

118
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,840
I don't want to do ordinary,

119
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,440
I want to take ordinary ingredients and make them taste extraordinary.

120
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Mary-Anne loves researching and creating new recipes.

121
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,320
She hopes to impress today with her roasted cauliflower,

122
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,920
cheese and caramelised onion quiche - with an interesting difference...

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,440
- Hey, Mary-Anne.
- Hello.

124
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,360
So you're doing quite a different quiche. Your pastry, for a start...

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm doing a suet crust with caraway seeds.

126
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,040
That explains why you're using self-raising flour - you're doing a suet crust, not a shortcrust.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
Self-raising flour, Paul...?

128
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,040
It's to give it a bit of air, because suet and everything is going to sit on it

129
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,880
and made it quite a dead dough, a dead paste - and that will just give it a little bit of a zip to it.

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,600
I've also added some fresh breadcrumbs in, to kind of lighten it up.

131
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
- See you later.
- Good luck.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,840
So how are you feeling? Did you sleep last night?

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,680
I didn't, no. Still lots of nerves, but I'm a bit better...

134
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Did you have quiche-related nightmares?

135
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,840
Quiche-related nightmares? Yeah, like Paul Hollywood coming out of my quiche and...

136
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,960
That's a mighty quiche if Paul can come out of it.

137
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,520
No - I didn't really grow up with quiche because it's not a particularly Indian dish.

138
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,960
- So do you think quiche is your nemesis then?
- Absolutely.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,480
Inspired by her extensive travelling, Urvashi loves using

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,320
exotic Southeast Asian flavours in her baking.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,560
She's seeing this as a chance to stand out from the crowd,

142
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
with an unusual crab, coriander and coconut quiche.

143
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,680
- I'm wondering where the coconut cream comes in. 
- Really?
- It's very, very sweet,

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,520
it's full of sugar. I have never done it - I'm going to wait and see.

145
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,880
- Something's changed - those onions aren't on the floor. 
- Everything's on the table, yeah.

146
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,360
Listen, what a spectacular recovery you made last week.

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,720
Thank you very much. It was a bit stressful, especially when I threw a cake on the floor.

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,520
- I am seeing the funny side of it now. 
- Good. 
- At the time, it wasn't very funny...

149
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,640
Rob has always had a strong creative streak, and dreams of one day working as a pastry chef.

150
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,160
He's decided to make a smoked bacon and kale quiche.

151
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,880
I think there's loads of time...

152
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,720
- You're very Zen. 
- Yeah. I am very Zen today.

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,680
Just...careful of the arms.

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,440
After just 12 minutes in the oven, the danger of pastry shrinking and bubbling is eliminated.

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,520
The foil and weights are removed, and the unfilled crust returned to the oven to brown.

156
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm just waiting for it to be absolutely baked blind

157
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,920
to the point where there's no sort of little bits left that are

158
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
slightly undercooked.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,520
It's looking good - I just want to make sure the base is absolutely cooked through.

160
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,640
It's feeling nice and firm at the moment but I just want to give it a couple of minutes to crisp up a bit.

161
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,040
Rotating the case will ensure it is baked evenly.

162
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,160
This is looking dry enough to take my filling now, hopefully.

163
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,040
If it isn't crisp throughout, the wet filling could seep into the crust and dampen it.

164
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,840
- So you're the youngest baker in the tournament?
- I am.

165
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,000
- So you think you can give a few of these old-timers a run for their money?
- I hope so.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Jason has only been baking for seven years, and hopes to take his baking

167
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,560
to a more professional level by taking part in the bake off.

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,280
He's gone for an Asian-inspired salmon and pak choi quiche.

169
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,520
I was looking for something different and I thought of sesame seeds -

170
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,280
and then sesame seeds led to salmon and pak choi.

171
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,520
So I said, yeah, I'm sure they'll like it.

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,800
Bakers, you're halfway through your quiche challenge.

173
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,840
You've got one hour to go.

174
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,800
The final stage is to fill and bake their quiches.

175
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,080
It's like a swamp... That's a big swamp of quiche!

176
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,240
Eggs are used in the quiche's filling, as they have a unique protein composition

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,840
that starts out as liquid, and rapidly develops a structure

178
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,480
that supports the other ingredients when heated.

179
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Jo, what's going on? It's all going on...

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
I've made a caramelised onion

181
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,840
with Gruyere cheese and thyme quiche.

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,760
You be very careful to not go over the edges, because it will stick and you won't get it out.

183
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,040
Now, have you baked that blind?

184
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,680
I have baked it blind, yeah.

185
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
- It is a little bit pale.
- Right, OK.

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,560
When you're baking blind, the whole idea is to cook the pastry and to lightly brown the pastry -

187
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,920
it's not to do any more browning because you're cooking that at a slightly lower temperature.

188
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,600
That is a little bit light to start with.

189
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,120
Watch your edges, I'm worried about those now.

190
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
- Steady hand!
- Steady hands.

191
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,040
Only 40 minutes left, and most of the bakers are putting their filled quiches in the oven.

192
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,720
- Whose quiche have you got your eye on?
- Mary-Anne's.

193
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,560
I've got her... If I was a betting woman, she's my winner.

194
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Everything she bakes, I actually want to eat.

195
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,120
I've just gone over there and eaten half of her ingredients, so...

196
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
If you could eat some more, then...

197
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,920
35 minutes on the clock.

198
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,760
- We haven't quite got 35 minutes. 
- What, you don't have time?

199
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,920
- We'll see how it goes. 
- How much time have we got?

200
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,560
I don't know, about half an hour.

201
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,520
Now, don't fail!

202
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,640
But Rob is still blind baking.

203
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,880
- Rob, what are you doing? 
- I was chilling out with the pastry too much.

204
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,640
What's going on in the oven? Your pastry's cooking?

205
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,600
- Yeah.
- Turn your oven up. 
- I've turned it up a bit.

206
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
- Well, good luck, Rob.
- Cheers. I know you're pushed for time.

207
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
I often feel like a schoolteacher with Rob. I feel every now and again

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
he needs a slap on the wrist and say, "Now, you MUST do better."

209
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,880
He had two hours - everybody else has managed to do it. Just get it done!

210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Stop messing around and get it in the oven.

211
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,040
He's quite sure of himself, but he IS behind,

212
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,480
and I don't know whether it's going to get finished.

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,720
Whether it's a savoury Lorraine, a tangy lemon or a sweet cherry, we all love our tarts.

214
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,360
But one legendary British king liked them so much,

215
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,080
he had a separate kitchen built in order to produce them.

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,640
The magnificent 16th-century palace of Hampton Court

217
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,000
has been home to some of our most celebrated kings and queens, including a certain Henry VIII.

218
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,960
He may be famous for six wives and a penchant for beheadings,

219
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,440
but Henry had another passion which transformed Hampton Court

220
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,320
into a Tudor baking factory - his love of tarts.

221
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Henry VIII had an impressive appetite.

222
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,920
We know this because we have his suits of armour.

223
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
His early ones, he has a 34-inch waist

224
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,120
with really broad shoulders - the guy is a real athlete.

225
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,480
His last suit of armour, 54-inch waist - he's really gone to seed.

226
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,600
With a passion for food and a court of 600 to feed,

227
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,840
when Henry VIII took over the palace in 1529,

228
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,080
he set about expanding the kitchens.

229
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
They soon covered an acre of land

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,680
and consisted of 55 rooms that were staffed by 200 cooks.

231
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,040
One of the kitchen's busiest departments

232
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,240
was built specifically to cater for the king's favourite dish.

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,280
The pastry is doing nothing but make pastry.

234
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,520
They're stood there rolling, mixing, kneading all day long

235
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,560
to produce what could be 300-400 tarts and pies a day.

236
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,600
When the kitchen's in full swing, you're going to need massive amounts of ingredients -

237
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,480
barrel loads of butter, tons of flour, huge amounts coming in here day after day.

238
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,720
As well as the pastry room, a confectionary kitchen was built

239
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,720
to whip up huge batches of fillings for hundreds of sweet tarts.

240
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,080
Tarts were seen as delicacies in the 16th century, and regarded as a dish of status.

241
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,920
They were difficult and delicate to make,

242
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,920
but they also presented a chance to showcase the finest ingredients.

243
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,760
A popular Tudor recipe was a rich strawberry tart,

244
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,880
which demanded the cook to squeeze the juice from the fresh fruit by hand.

245
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Serving seeds to the king could have cost you your head.

246
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,760
When you're a Tudor king, it's all about the ingredients.

247
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,880
The best of British is going to be on the table, but it's all about food miles.

248
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
You can bring it all together in a tart.

249
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,960
Lovely British strawberries, but then flavoured with Persian sugar

250
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,000
and a hint of ginger from the Orient.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,240
It wasn't just the opulent, luxurious tarts the king is thought to have enjoyed -

252
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,080
legend said his favourite was a very small, sweet, simple cheese tart

253
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,360
called a Maid of Honour.

254
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,320
King Henry is supposed to have happened upon Queen Anne,

255
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,120
with ladies in waiting, and they were eating tarts from a silver dish.

256
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,680
He tried one and it was so good that he wanted no-one else to have it,

257
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,800
and so the recipe was locked up in an iron box.

258
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Another version of this story is that it wasn't the recipe

259
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,880
they locked away, it was the maid who knew how to make them.

260
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,840
20 minutes to go in the signature bake.

261
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,800
We're at the waiting in anticipation stage,

262
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,600
and fidgeting and hoping that it works stage...

263
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
My quiche is in the oven,

264
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,560
but I had it on the wrong setting on the oven,

265
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,960
so it was in there for about half an hour not cooking at all.

266
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Mum-of-three Yasmin bakes daily for her family

267
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,840
and is still hoping there's time for her smoked haddock and watercress quiche to turn out as planned.

268
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,640
It looks nice, just not set really,

269
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,080
but I'm concerned because it was in the oven

270
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,040
for about half an hour with all that liquid just sitting on the pastry.

271
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,760
So I could get the soggy bottom...

272
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,600
We'll just have to wait.

273
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,320
That's ten-minute call, ten minutes to get your quiches turned out,

274
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,800
put on the end of your workstations and presented ready - face-up, please, Rob!

275
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,360
Smells really good. Mmm.

276
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,840
It's a little browned on one side, but hey,

277
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,640
you can't have everything - but it should hopefully taste very good.

278
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,840
Ah.

279
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
No, it's not going to come off the bottom tin.

280
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,360
Ah, nightmare.

281
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm really pleased with the overall effect - spot on, I think.

282
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Happy with that.

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,360
I'm quite pleased with it. It looks OK.

284
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
We'll know when we taste it.

285
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,040
It's like anything, it doesn't matter what it looks like, to some extent -

286
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,480
if it doesn't taste nice then it's a fail. So...

287
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,760
I don't know how set it is in the middle - that's the only thing.

288
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
- How long we got?
- Three minutes. 
- Three? BLEEP.

289
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
I did make a conscious effort to make my quiche look nice -

290
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,480
hopefully the judges will be impressed.

291
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Bakers, your time is up.

292
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,880
Yeah, it was a bit down to the wire!

293
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,760
- Hello, Ian!
- Hello! 
- This looks...it looks tempting.

294
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,920
There's a lot going on in here. The texture of it is excellent.

295
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,240
What we haven't done is turned it upside down to see how the bottom is.

296
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,120
- Excellent. Not good, excellent. 
- Relief.
- That's perfect. 
- It's got a good base. Good colour.

297
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,560
For me, this is just too sweet.

298
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,360
It's a very unusual thing to put a sweetened coconut in with the crab.

299
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
- I've totally lost the crab.
- OK.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,880
What you've got is a very mild Thai meal inside that.

301
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,280
As a quiche...do you know what, I'm in that situation where I don't know whether I like it.

302
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Janet, it needed a little more cooking.

303
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Nightmare, I'm sorry about that.

304
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,320
The pastry is absolutely delicious.

305
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
Thank you.

306
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,160
That's tasting really rather good. The dill comes through

307
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,440
in the pastry and I think it goes very well.

308
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,680
It doesn't look anything special

309
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,440
- but it certainly tastes very special.
- Thank you.

310
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
- I'm afraid I'm not mad about it. 
- Doesn't work for me.

311
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
Pesto is designed to be an accompaniment -

312
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,320
it's too much, it's too much in a quiche.

313
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,280
Hello, Yasmin...

314
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,680
Yasmin's mistake with her oven settings

315
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
means she's unsure whether her quiche has baked properly.

316
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,920
It's got a great colour.

317
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,480
It looks very good. Not a soggy bottom.

318
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,120
- I'm just going to turn it over to have a...
- See the bottom.

319
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,880
It's all right! But it needed just a little bit longer cooking -

320
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
in the middle here, it just needs to be slightly more set.

321
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,560
Yeah.

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,520
- You got it in the oven in the end. 
- I did, yeah.

323
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,080
The kale does nothing for me.

324
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,040
You can't taste the kale - but that pastry is superb. Very, very good.

325
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,840
It looks a mess.

326
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,400
- Really?
- Yeah.
- OK.

327
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
The actual bake. It's a bit pale.

328
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,240
It doesn't tempt me to eat it.

329
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,400
But once I get going, it's jolly good.

330
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,920
- Well...
- There we go.

331
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,080
Doesn't that look different? Lovely and brown round the outside.

332
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,920
- Shall we dare to have a look underneath?
- No, I think...

333
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,480
We like to have a look underneath, don't we?

334
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,800
- Oh, dear.
- That is a soggy bottom.

335
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,200
- Soggy bottom. 
- That's one wet bottom, that one!

336
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,760
It looks unappetising.

337
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,080
- Mmm.
- The pastry's OK but it needs more colour. It's very dry.

338
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
It tastes really lovely.

339
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,160
- Oh, thank you. 
- But it just doesn't look it.

340
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,680
Looks great.

341
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,160
There's a lot of stuff in there, I can see that.

342
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,080
You've done well with the custard part - not a bubble, it's just set.

343
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,400
The salmon flavour is spectacular.

344
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,320
I am getting some great flavours coming through.

345
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,640
Thank you very much.

346
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,880
Jason and Ian have really impressed the judges,

347
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,040
but going into round two, Joanne, Mary-Anne and last week's star baker Holly

348
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,200
must up their game if they're going to stand a chance of staying in the bake off.

349
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,600
They hated it! So that's not good!

350
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm not sure what they meant when they said it was quite different.

351
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean, it has cheese in, it's got eggs in, it has a pastry crust - voila quiche!

352
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,800
From the flamboyance and creativity of the signature bake,

353
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,720
the second challenge is by contrast tightly-controlled and a complete surprise.

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,560
Now comes the technical bake.

355
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,080
So, deep breath, what we're going to be asking you to do

356
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,280
is a tarte au citron, according to a Mary Berry recipe - so no pressure.

357
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,000
Honestly, no pressure. You can breath out now. Breathe!

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Now, the technical challenge is judged blind, so we're going to be

359
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,600
asking Paul and Mary, please, to vacate the tent.

360
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,680
OK, you have 1.5 hours to complete this challenge.

361
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,240
On your marks, get set, bake.

362
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,720
Each baker has been given exactly the same list of ingredients

363
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,560
and a basic recipe to create the perfect tarte au citron or lemon tart.

364
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,520
- You made one of these before? 
- I haven't, actually.

365
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,600
Never. I do like it but I'm a bit scared of sweet pastry,

366
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
but I'll just mess it up big time...

367
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,120
- There's a lot of fear coming through there.
- It's making Mary's lemon tart for Mary.

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,760
The technical challenge is unique, allowing the judges to directly compare the bakers' abilities.

369
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,360
The best thing about blind judging is that you judge the product in front of you, not the person.

370
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,400
I think sometimes when we're judging, we can think back of what's just happened,

371
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,520
and we think "Maybe we should give them that extra chance."

372
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,320
To be honest, when it comes to blind bake, nobody gets an extra chance.

373
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,440
With minimal instructions, they must use all their baking knowledge

374
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,760
to interpret the recipe correctly

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,960
and deliver a perfect result to the judging table.

376
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,680
Tarte au citron, then, Mary!

377
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,400
- Lemon tart.
- Lemon tart.

378
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
- Can I have a look?
- You can.

379
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,360
To me, it's a piece de resistance.

380
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,880
It's got to have that wafer-thin pastry, lovely and crisp underneath.

381
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
Shouldn't have a bubble in it.

382
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
That is absolutely beautiful.

383
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,920
The first job for the bakers is to create the sweet crust pastry.

384
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,960
It's kind of like a sweet version of the shortcrust

385
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,560
that we did before for the quiche, so I'm relatively familiar with it.

386
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Sweet crust however contains sugar, which slows down

387
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,520
the formation of gluten strands,

388
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,000
creating a pastry that's delicate and hard to work with.

389
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,040
The recipe the bakers are following does not specify

390
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,840
how the pastry should be mixed or what the consistency should be when rolled.

391
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,360
I disagree strongly with the use of a lot of machines when preparing pastry.

392
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,680
I think it's crucial that you learn what the dough or paste should feel like.

393
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,280
If you can do it by hand, by rubbing the butter within your flour, add your egg,

394
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,360
knead it just enough so the gluten binds that paste together - that will make a fantastic pastry.

395
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,840
Oh, it's just so soft.

396
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,160
A soft, oily pastry is caused by the butter being too warm when mixed with the dry ingredients.

397
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,960
A bit like bill-stickers' paste, isn't it?

398
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,480
Can always add a bit of flour, soak it all up, and hope for the best.

399
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,840
Just very annoying.

400
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,000
Adding extra flour can make the pastry tough.

401
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,880
It should be chilled in a freezer for a few minutes to solidify the butter,

402
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
- making it easier to roll and line the tin. 
- Trying to be optimistic.

403
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,720
Criticised for her pastry in the signature bake,

404
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,760
Jo needs to make sure it is perfect this time around.

405
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,880
The pressure's definitely on. I'm trying to forget what happened last time and just concentrating on this.

406
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,040
Back home in Essex, Joanne bakes up to ten times a week for her friends and family.

407
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,960
- I'm just going to have to patch this.
- But early on, she's already facing problems with her casing.

408
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,120
I didn't realise how temperamental pastry is.

409
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I kept some trimmings and I've just made a little extra wall on it so hopefully that will rescue it.

410
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,360
I love tarte au citron.

411
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,920
So have you made loads before?

412
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,560
- I haven't made loads and I don't normally make it with quite such a soft pastry.
- Right.

413
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,960
- So it could be interesting.
- Right.

414
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,080
# A fugitive running... #

415
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,680
Ben was taught to cook by his grandmother, who has passed on her passion for baking.

416
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,640
# ..Fallen from grace... #

417
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,760
I was always taught a shortcrust pastry should be very, very pale,

418
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,600
which is what I'd got today and I was very happy with it.

419
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,520
So to be told that it's not coloured enough was a bit of a like, oh...

420
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,720
But there's no point in arguing about it, and I'll take that and move that through into this.

421
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,360
With pastry cases lined, it's time for the blind bake.

422
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,360
As with the quiches, Mary and Paul will be looking for perfectly golden and crisp pastry cases.

423
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,400
Because it's all in the pastry and the crunch, and it looks all right but, God, who knows?!

424
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,040
There's a little crack in the bottom of my case, you know.

425
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,960
My plan is just to make a tiny little bit more pastry to fill in that gap.

426
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,880
Hey, hey, hey. Yeah.

427
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,640
Oh, no.

428
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,360
- Are we facing the collapse of the pastry wall?
- Yep. We are.

429
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,280
I've never had it collapse on me or anything before.

430
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,960
I'm really fed up that I'm making silly mistakes and I don't know why.

431
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,440
And I really thought I was going to be all right with the pastry, but...we will see.

432
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,120
45 minutes to go.

433
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,240
With the pastries blind baking, the next task is to make the lemon filling.

434
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,520
The filling is flavoured with an equal amount of sugar to lemon juice.

435
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,080
I think wishy-washy lemon's not worth having, you know, I think

436
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,000
if you have something lemony, it's got to be really sharp,

437
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,360
so it sort of gets all your jaws going, you know.

438
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,280
The cases need to be filled right to the top.

439
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,000
Pouring the custard filling into the case while it's already in the oven helps prevent spilling.

440
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,800
Any leaked liquid will burn the crust during baking.

441
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,560
I've never made anything like this before, never made any flat, fine, fiddly tart thing.

442
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
It's not in my nature.

443
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,960
I'm actually enjoying this quite a lot.

444
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,040
The final stumbling block for our bakers

445
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,720
is when to take their tarts out of the oven.

446
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm probably going to give it just another couple of minutes to make sure it's all right.

447
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,680
Take it out too soon and it won't set properly -

448
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,240
something Janet is all too aware of.

449
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,160
The quiche was not cooked totally in the middle, which was a bit of a downer.

450
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,920
So I think I'll need to leave it as long as I possibly can.

451
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,840
Leave it in too long and they risk boiling the filling,

452
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,240
which will result in a cracked top and air bubbles in the mixture.

453
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,520
I've kind of based it on a similar tart I've done before with custard.

454
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,800
You take it out when there's just a little bit of wobble in the middle,

455
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,120
so I've applied that principle, and fingers crossed it'll work.

456
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
In the lap of the gods now.

457
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,400
I think everyone's just hoping, more than actually knowing

458
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,240
that it's going to go right - including myself.

459
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,960
Bakers, lemon tarts wait for no man nor woman.

460
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,040
You have three minutes left, please.

461
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,480
Better or worse, out you come.

462
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
And you needn't start exploding either.

463
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,600
Please, please!

464
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,480
Moment of truth. As it stands now it looks OK.

465
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,000
If there's any time for trimming off the mess that's baked on the outside of the case, then I'll be happier.

466
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,040
I don't think it's a disaster.

467
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,600
It doesn't look like a disaster, because at least it's not runny.

468
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,680
I hope it's enough to get me through.

469
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,040
I like a really lemony tarte au citron so when it comes to the taste, we'll see what they think.

470
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,280
I'm hoping that will be rescued.

471
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,480
If it was at home it'd be good enough, but it might not be good enough for the judges.

472
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,400
So we will see.

473
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,240
OK, that's tart termination time. That's your lot!

474
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,280
The judging for the technical bake is different to the other challenges,

475
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,920
as Paul and Mary have not watched the bakers working.

476
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,280
This means they will rank them from best to worst without knowing which tart belongs to which baker.

477
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,680
Good gracious.

478
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,760
11 really lovely tartes au citron.

479
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,600
They're all of a jolly good standard.

480
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,040
Come on, let's get stuck in.

481
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,000
It's a bit thick on the pastry.

482
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,640
Tastes good, but you expect that - it's a Mary Berry recipe!

483
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,160
LAUGHTER This one looks a little bit darker.

484
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,640
There's a crack in the top of this one.

485
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,560
It is slightly over-baked.

486
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,680
A thinner pastry on this one.

487
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,240
I think that the blind bake wasn't long enough, and that's been boiled.

488
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,680
Nice to have thin pastry, though.

489
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,840
- This one looks like a patchwork quilt.
- Good bake.
- What's that?

490
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,040
That's the join in the pastry. It's folded in the corner here.

491
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,320
When you line the bottom of a tin, you've got to press it to the side all the way around.

492
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,120
This hasn't been pressed enough so you've doubled up, so it's got a thick rim all the way around it.

493
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,560
It's a disaster the way that's been lined. This one looks good.

494
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,240
Thin crust... It is not shrinking away from the side.

495
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,400
The filling is beautifully creamy.

496
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,240
- Now this next one has definitely been overdone.
- Absolutely.

497
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,360
It's shrinking away from the sides and has been in the oven too long.

498
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
The pastry lining on this looks quite neat.

499
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,280
- It's a good bake.
- Very good bake. 
- The base is excellent.

500
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,520
And also a good ratio between the pastry and the amount of filling.

501
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah, that's nice, that one. This one looks impressive.

502
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,880
It's a lovely pastry.

503
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,560
Slightly thicker pastry on the bottom. The topping's lovely,

504
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,480
but the pastry underneath is not crisp.

505
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,240
- It needed a bit longer on the blind bake.
- Nice finish of pastry there.

506
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,680
- It's nice and neat, isn't it?
- Yes.

507
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,800
Good ratio of filling to base.

508
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,000
Lovely and crisp underneath that one. And we come to the last one.

509
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,560
Very nice short pastry.

510
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,000
Paul and Mary must now decide which baker showed the best technical ability with their tart.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,800
We'll start with the lowest...

512
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,520
- which is...
- This person.

513
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,880
Simon.

514
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,200
Slightly overdone. Pastry's a bit of a mess.

515
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,680
And in tenth place, we have...

516
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,720
- this person.
- It's me.

517
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,240
That's you, Jo. It was a bit of a disaster.

518
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,520
Mary-Anne has had yet another bad round, finishing ninth, followed by Janet in eighth...

519
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,240
Oh, not again.

520
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,360
..Urvashi in seventh...

521
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,120
- Me.
- ..and Yasmin in sixth.

522
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,680
Rob finishes a good day in fifth, and after being in the bottom two

523
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,040
with her quiche, Holly's fourth place gives her some breathing room going into the final day.

524
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,200
- And in third place...
- Hello!

525
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,800
Jason, what a pretty decoration you've put on.

526
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,720
In second place...

527
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,160
is this one.

528
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,800
That's a nice lemon tart.

529
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,320
And the winner is...

530
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Ben.

531
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
It is nigh perfect.

532
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,040
'I'm shocked, I'm shocked.'

533
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,320
I was seriously not expecting that.

534
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,520
I'd quite happily run and jump around and scream and shout, but I'm a bit too reserved for that,

535
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,160
unless I've got a spotlight on me. But I've got to nail it tomorrow

536
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,560
because I think people will be watching now.

537
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,240
'To be at the top of the pile today feels great.'

538
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't let it go to my head, but I am going to bask in it

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,240
for the time that it is, and hopefully continue to do well.

540
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,640
'I am disappointed.'

541
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,200
I did expect to come bottom, especially when I put the tart down next to everyone else's.

542
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,240
But tomorrow's another day so, yeah, come out fighting, same as usual.

543
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,440
'I really don't know what went wrong today.'

544
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,160
I just think I made silly mistakes, really, all day.

545
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,240
'The boys will be really disappointed.'

546
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,800
Actually, that was what was going through my mind at the end of it.

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
I was just thinking, "Oh, God, I've let everyone down."

548
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,760
It's the final day in the second round of the bake off.

549
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,600
This is the last chance the bakers have to impress Paul and Mary,

550
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,840
and for one of them to avoid being sent home.

551
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,440
If we look over the two challenges yesterday,

552
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,040
who's in trouble and needs to pull out all the stops today?

553
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,240
- Simon. Simon's quiche - the flavours were good...
- Yes.

554
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,960
..but the reason why he's put in the danger zone is because he came bottom

555
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,600
and he burnt the whole lemon tart.

556
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,880
That's why he's in the position he is now.

557
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,280
Mary-Anne, she was the only one who did the suet crust for her quiche,

558
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
- but it wasn't done in the middle. It fell apart.
- It was a raw bottom.

559
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,960
She's got the knowledge there, but her work is clumsy.

560
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,840
Jo is another one.

561
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,120
Which is a surprise - she had such a great first week.

562
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,040
But when you're looking at the quiche...

563
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,000
- It was anaemic.
- It looked insipid.

564
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
It didn't hit me - "Wow, I want to tuck into that."

565
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,320
She's got to really pick her game up for this one.

566
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,440
Bakers, this is your final bake.

567
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,520
It's your chance to really show off and show the judges

568
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:11,080
what you can do. And I have to say, Paul and Mary are expecting nothing less than pastry miracles.

569
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,520
What we're looking for is a selection of miniature, sweet tarts.

570
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,840
The pastry's got to be super thin and well-baked

571
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:25,480
and we're looking for a batch of 24. We're looking for consistency across that number, so no pressure(!)

572
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,640
And of course we will be saying goodbye to one of you at the end of today, so all

573
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,720
that remains is for you to put in a blinding performance. Good luck!

574
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,880
'The final showstopper bake is the most demanding pastry challenge the bakers have faced,

575
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,000
'as it combines baking intricate tarts in bulk, where one small mistake will stand out.'

576
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,240
Make sure I use the right thing - that would be great, wouldn't it, all the wrong stuff(?)

577
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,520
Paul and Mary want to see two dozen intricate tarts

578
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,560
showcasing two flavour combinations AND decorative skills.

579
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,520
Each tart must be exactly the same in size, taste and appearance.

580
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,360
These little showstopper tarts are really quite difficult

581
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,120
- for the bakers because they're not used to doing large quantities. 
- It's consistency.

582
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,200
Consistency not only in their pastry and their rolling out, but consistency in their bake.

583
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm just about to roll out...

584
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,960
and to start lining my pastry cases.

585
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,280
I've put it in clingfilm for a couple of reasons - one, to stop me

586
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,120
touching the pastry quite as much as I need to, and to stop me adding

587
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,000
more flour to the mixture...

588
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,400
so keeping it nice and short.

589
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,200
And also I find it lets you get it a little bit thinner as well,

590
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,440
which is important for this challenge.

591
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,240
I just want to get the pastry right today.

592
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,400
I just want to make sure it's all perfect today.

593
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,960
Having been in the bottom two in the signature and technical bakes,

594
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,680
Joanne knows everything rests on how she performs today.

595
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,480
She's making raspberry and mascarpone tarts with

596
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,000
a lemon and almond pastry and honey and almond tarts with a sweet crust.

597
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,160
It doesn't matter how good your fillings are,

598
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,360
without the pastry being good, you know, that's the whole

599
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,480
essence of a tart, really, isn't it?

600
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,120
As they are making smaller, more intricate bakes,

601
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,360
every aspect of the process needs to be precisely executed.

602
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,880
Tiny little tarts, big hands - not necessarily a good combination.

603
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,000
So I do find them a little bit fiddly.

604
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
How long have we got? I keep losing track of time.

605
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,920
Time goes so terribly fast when you're trying to get on with stuff.

606
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,360
Janet has opted for two quite traditional tart recipes.

607
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,640
The first is red fruits with lemon mascarpone and the second, chocolate ganache and cherries.

608
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,720
It's straightforward, but done well, it tastes fantastic.

609
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,080
I hope they're nice flavours, and visually I wanted something that looked pretty.

610
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,800
The essence of miniature tarts is little ones need to be a feast for the eyes as well for the taste.

611
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,840
It's easier to push pastry in with another bit of pastry, and I know

612
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Paul's got a real thing about having rounded corners,

613
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,640
so I'm trying to get my corners as sharp as possible.

614
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,840
With tins lined, it's time for the blind bake.

615
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Hot rice bags!

616
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,160
You shouldn't use greaseproof paper, because it leaves marks...

617
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,080
on your pastry, so if you use clingfilm bags and as long as

618
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,040
bake at a low enough temperature, you won't get the marks.

619
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,720
- Is life too short to be making hot rice bags?
- I did think that as I was doing it.

620
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,760
I thought it doesn't matter, but it matters to Paul and it matters to Mary, so it matters to me.

621
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,240
Hoping to hold onto her title of star baker,

622
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,600
Holly's making milk chocolate and pistachio tarts and her husband's favourite, trifle tarts.

623
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,800
Oh, God!

624
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,400
The pastries go into the oven.

625
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,880
Timings are crucial with miniature tarts.

626
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,800
Their size means they bake quickly, and therefore there's much less margin for error.

627
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,680
In just a minute, they can turn from being underdone to burnt.

628
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,480
It all looks nice and calm in your kitchen today.

629
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah, it's not!

630
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,200
- Can you run through your two tarts?
- He's jogging!

631
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
It isn't just baking for Rob, it's like a fitness DVD at the same time.

632
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,520
Sorry. I am doing a, erm...

633
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,560
chocolate with fennel and ginger.

634
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,840
OK.

635
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,080
Then I'm doing a almond pastry with creme patissiere and poached pear.

636
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,960
- Are you all right for time? Er...
- No! Look at him, he's tight.

637
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,960
That's the only thing that's going to let me down today, and I really don't want it to.

638
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,000
You take it to the line every single time.

639
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,080
Yeah, I know, it's stressful baking.

640
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,480
Manage your time better, and then you'll be all right, you'll be fine.

641
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,960
All right.

642
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,400
Ben has started on his fillings.

643
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm just rubbing inside of the bowl with some lemon juice.

644
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,680
I'm making some meringue in a minute for the lemon mousse.

645
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,720
Just by putting lemon juice in there,

646
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,800
we can get rid of any fat, and hopefully get a nice rise

647
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,160
into the meringues.

648
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,600
After coming in last place in the technical bake, Simon has to up his game in this final challenge.

649
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,280
- Are the family being supportive? 
- Very, yeah.

650
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,440
What have they been telling you? What have they been saying?

651
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,040
"Don't fail, don't lose, and if you do lose, don't come home!"

652
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,360
He's hoping his 12 passion fruit and ricotta and 12 salted chocolate and

653
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,400
stem ginger tarts will be enough to keep him in the competition.

654
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm not keen on this salt and chocolate business.

655
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,960
It is quite daring, actually.

656
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,920
If he gets that balance right, he could create something magical.

657
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,360
Because I did quite well yesterday, I'm not really feeling more pressure today.

658
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm just taking it how it comes.

659
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,800
I'm happy I did well, but I'm not going to sit in it and think, "Hey, that's me done."

660
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,920
Hoping to build on his success, Jason is making mint chocolate tarts and blueberry Bakewell tarts.

661
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,480
Jason's recipe doesn't require a blind bake as the frangipane

662
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,720
and blueberry jam filling is baked at the same time as the pastry.

663
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,840
I'd love to be named the star baker today!

664
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,600
Part of being in this competition is to win it. I know for me, anyway.

665
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,640
It's half way through the showstopper challenge,

666
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,680
and the blind-bake tart shells are coming out.

667
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,320
- What's happening, then?
- Still a little bit stuck, that's all.

668
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,640
There it comes. Got it, got it, got it, got it. That was tense.

669
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,640
- Particularly with you standing there!
- The pastry seems to be all right, thank goodness,

670
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,480
so now I'm just making the fillings for my almond tart.

671
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,480
They've just caught on the edges a bit. I think I set the oven too high.

672
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,960
I pipe cream all the way to the edges anyway, so you won't see the edge of the case,

673
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,000
and I'll have to trim off where I've burnt.

674
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,480
Not a major drama, but...you know, keep calm, carry on.

675
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,880
Despite his earlier confidence following the blind bake...

676
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,400
Grrr!

677
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,600
..Rob's discovered a problem with his pastry.

678
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,440
They won't come out.

679
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,080
The pastry has too much butter in it, and so the whole thing separated,

680
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,800
but there's nothing I can do now,

681
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
because they're baked, so I can't make another one.

682
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,640
They're knackered, they're absolutely knackered.

683
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,400
I'd throw these straight in the bin, but I can't do anything. I'm trying to keep calm.

684
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,240
Now, you may have thought that the French have the monopoly on fantastic tarts,

685
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,080
or tartes fantastiques, as they say in France, but one of the world's most famous tarts

686
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,520
comes from a little town in the middle of the English countryside.

687
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,320
Bakewell, a tiny, remote town in the Peak District, is home to one of the world's most famous tarts.

688
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,840
Famous the world over, the Bakewell tart owes its international success

689
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,160
not to planes, trains or even automobiles,

690
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,320
but to the humble horse-drawn stagecoach.

691
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,720
In the early 1800s, they were the only way to travel great distances.

692
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,200
Towns like Bakewell were put on the map along with their local delicacies.

693
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,320
The Bakewell tart actually is known locally as a Bakewell pudding.

694
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,400
It was invented in the Rutland Arms by a Mrs Greaves in about the 1820s.

695
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,680
The hotel was a popular staging post on the 200-mile route from London to Manchester.

696
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,120
These stopping points gave the drivers a chance to change their horses and the passengers

697
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,760
an opportunity to have a good night's sleep and feast on local food.

698
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,200
The local legend says

699
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,080
that one day she asked her maid to make a strawberry tart,

700
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,880
and the maid made a mistake and out came the Bakewell pudding.

701
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,760
I don't believe that that's true.

702
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,320
I think Mrs Greaves invented it as a special dish for her guests.

703
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,840
The Rutland Arms had a major reputation for food.

704
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,960
It had extremely distinguished guests.

705
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,520
You've got people like the King of Saxony staying here, you've got Jane Austen.

706
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,960
It had to be up to the mark in terms of its food and hospitality.

707
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,040
Charles Dickens was another famous visitor, and he wrote

708
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,880
about eating a Bakewell pudding, describing it as a local delicacy.

709
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,760
I think the Bakewell pudding became so famous because of the people who

710
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,720
endorsed it - the aristocracy, the noblemen who stayed at the hotel, who took it to London.

711
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,400
They would talk about this and ask their cooks and their caterers to try and replicate this pudding.

712
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,280
There was fashion in those days, as there is now,

713
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,320
and when these famous people endorsed this pudding, then everybody wanted to try it.

714
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,440
Word of the pudding spread far and fast.

715
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,840
In 1837, a few years after its invention, a similar recipe was

716
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,280
published in a cookery book 4,000 miles away in America.

717
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,360
A global baking sensation was born, all made possible by a rickety horse-drawn coach.

718
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,200
OK, 30 minutes left.

719
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,600
Just 30 minutes left.

720
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,080
The bakers begin to fill and dress their tarts.

721
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,760
These are just slices of apple that I've poached in apple juice

722
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,840
and sugar, and then when you roll them up,

723
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,080
they magically turn into little apple rosettes which look fabulous.

724
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,720
Knowing that she could be in trouble if she doesn't deliver today,

725
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,920
Mary Anne is once again attempting something out of the ordinary.

726
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm not going to be here again, so I might as well go all out, eh?

727
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,560
Now, I'm no experienced cook, but this looks like you've cut it pretty fine time-wise.

728
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,960
Yeah, and I've messed up with the creme patissiere.

729
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Ah, you've curdled it. Do you think the pressure of it's just got to you?

730
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,360
I've totally cracked this time.

731
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,440
Last week, Urvashi was criticised by Mary for using inedible flowers as decoration.

732
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,640
- I was mortified, so I got out one of Mary's books from the library and it's got...
- You swot!

733
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,160
..a double-page spread of edible flowers. It's great,

734
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,080
because it's got violas and I started growing violas last year.

735
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,440
Urvashi wants to stun the judges this week with her strawberry and

736
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,400
basil tarts and elderflower tarts garnished with homemade honeycomb.

737
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,320
My girls love watching this, because it is just magic when it all bubbles up...

738
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,680
- I've never seen honeycomb being made.
- Really?

739
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,920
Honeycomb is made by rapidly boiling butter, sugar and golden syrup.

740
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,480
It's there, yeah.

741
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,200
When it reaches 140 degrees Celsius, bicarbonate of soda is added.

742
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,040
Ah!

743
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,720
It's like magic.

744
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,840
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't that brilliant?

745
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,600
Reacting with the hot sugar, bubbles of carbon dioxide form,

746
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,360
giving the honeycomb its unique structure.

747
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,280
- I love that. 
- It's just like bubble magic.

748
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,880
- That's brilliant.
- Isn't it wicked? Hopefully, it will set.

749
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,880
Ten minutes left, everyone, ten minutes left.

750
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,400
I am really pushing it for time again.

751
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,480
Oh... Hello, sailor.

752
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,800
Look...at that.

753
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,720
What's happened with the pastry?

754
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,800
It's burnt. Overall, if I was going to make a bad job of pastry,

755
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,040
this is pretty much how I'd set out to do it.

756
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,880
That ganache hasn't thickened up.

757
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,840
Really disappointed, really disappointed. Quick miffed, really.

758
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,280
I can't do anything about it.

759
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,360
I won't be able to turn these ones out, because the pastry won't set.

760
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,280
so I'm just making them look a tiny, tiny bit better than they do.

761
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,160
I just have a mantra in my head.

762
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,440
"You can't get it wrong." So even if you are getting it wrong,

763
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,240
you've still got a chance to redeem yourself.

764
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,960
Now I've got two good fillings. Let's see how we get on.

765
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,760
Back in the game!

766
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,000
Bakers, leave those tarts alone.

767
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,040
Your time is officially up.

768
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,080
The remaining 11 bakers have now done all they can,

769
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,640
but only ten can make it through and be in with a chance

770
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,480
of winning the Great British Bake Off.

771
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,040
Jo, you're up first.

772
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,320
It's the moment of truth for Joanne, and the last chance

773
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,680
to convince the judges to keep her in the competition.

774
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,160
The raspberry ones look fantastic.

775
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,680
Cooked well.

776
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,560
Wasn't that nice going through that crisp pastry?

777
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,120
That's what we're looking for.

778
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,520
Nice flavours.

779
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,680
- Thank you.
- Then we come to the...her lemon ones.

780
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,360
Lovely thin pastry there.

781
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,640
That one melts, it flakes.

782
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,480
And you've got this lovely runny honey in the bottom.

783
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,400
The taste of that one is excellent.

784
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,640
You've got them all very uniform. This is what we were asking you for.

785
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,880
You've made them like little soldiers.

786
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,640
The pastry looks a little on the thick side to me.

787
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,880
It's over baked and too thick. Your fillings are good, your

788
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,880
piping work is second to none, but again the pastries have let you down.

789
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,200
- It could be a thing of beauty this, Jason.
- I've left you the blueberry, did you notice that?
- I did!

790
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,320
- It's great.
- Thank you.

791
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,680
I like the way you've decorated it as well.

792
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,200
It's simple but quite arty.

793
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,640
How pretty those apples look!

794
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,440
You've just achieved something, to me, that's quite new on the top there.

795
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,480
The filling is scrummy.

796
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,480
- They're quite deep and big.
- Yeah.

797
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,440
- You've bitten off more than you can chew, Paul!
- Definitely!

798
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,680
I love the look of them. I adore the way it looks.

799
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,240
- Thank you.
- It is stunning.

800
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,200
- How pretty do those look! 
- Don't they?

801
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Full of style and most attractive.

802
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,000
But really it's delicious, it's very, very nice.

803
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,520
That you could put in a decent establishment - to sell.

804
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Could you, really? Oh, my goodness, thank you.

805
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,480
Very, very good.

806
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,520
APPLAUSE I might take a few back tonight.

807
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,960
Ah, that's really sweet, thank you.

808
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,720
I said to you, you really should be able to eat

809
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,360
all the decoration, and haven't you done well!

810
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,480
Of course, violets, violas are totally edible,

811
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,200
and they look so pretty, particularly against the yellow.

812
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,240
What was in this pastry again?

813
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,520
- Just a straightforward pastry. 
- Which you burnt.

814
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,960
- It's very overcooked, Simon. 
- It is very overcooked, yes.

815
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,600
I'm getting chocolate.

816
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,400
Mm.

817
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,000
- And it is quite...it's salted well. 
- Thank you.

818
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,560
- But that case is... 
- Oh, it's horrific.

819
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,880
- It's a non-starter. 
- That's rather a shame, really.

820
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,120
Robert, Robert...

821
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,680
Oh, dear, you're capable of such great things, you know.

822
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,120
Tastes really good. What else can I say?

823
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,000
- The problem is, it's a mess. 
- Yeah.

824
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,240
This isn't the first time that you've been in this situation.

825
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,200
- I'm disappointed, to be honest. 
- These are not good enough.

826
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,080
It's getting to know that they had kind of like big hopes for me and then basically not delivered.

827
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:13,000
I think I've done enough to be able to stay, but I also think that I've messed up enough to go.

828
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,200
Basically, I'm fearing the worst.

829
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,000
I think the person who's most obviously at risk of going home would be Rob.

830
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
We'll see how that one goes.

831
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm obviously hoping, really, really praying that I stay, but

832
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,160
I had a really bad day yesterday, so I am quite concerned still.

833
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,480
Mary and Paul look back over the weekend's offerings individually

834
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,600
before deciding who they think should leave the Great British Bake Off.

835
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,120
But first, who will be named star baker?

836
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,360
Jason's had a really good time, hasn't he?

837
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,000
That blueberry with the frangipane, great.

838
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,240
Ian's also had a very good weekend, possibly the best quiche in the room.

839
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,760
I was mad about the casing of it, so crisp it looked beautiful.

840
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,360
And he had an amazing tarte au citron, let's not forget.

841
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,880
Again, the flavours were good, pastry was very good.

842
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,920
So is he in the running to be star baker?

843
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,720
For me, it's very, very close.

844
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,560
Let's look at the other end of the spectrum.

845
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,360
You identified that you thought Joanne and Simon were in trouble.

846
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,280
Joanne had a bad day yesterday.

847
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,880
Tenth in the tarte citron, second from bottom.

848
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,600
- The worst quiche. 
- It's not good for her.

849
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,120
Today, though, her tart was pretty good.

850
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:26,960
We were looking for something that was beautifully presented, and she made excellent pastry.

851
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,120
- Now, Simon.
- The main reason why Simon is in the bottom is because he

852
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,800
- came last in the lemon tart.
- What did you make of his tarts, Mary?

853
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,160
Simon's pastry is really overcooked.

854
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,040
The flavour's all right. The pastry's knackered, it's burnt.

855
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,320
- You liked the chocolate salt, though?
- The actual filling of the chocolate was lovely,

856
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,600
but when you look at it, it isn't of a standard that we're looking for.

857
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,000
I'll tell you another person that needs a mention - Rob.

858
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,160
That is disgusting. How dare that be put up!

859
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,520
If he can't do it, then he shouldn't be in the competition.

860
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,760
He's got the skills, he's got the technique.

861
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,720
- Yeah.
- He's just not organised.

862
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,640
It grates me that he bothered turning up to create that.

863
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,240
- You're forgetting that yesterday he had two very good results. 
- It doesn't make any difference.

864
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,360
This is a fundamental disagreement that you need to resolve.

865
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,040
- It's a Paul and Mary moment. 
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

866
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,360
Bakers, let's start with the positive.

867
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,240
The person that the judges felt this weekend really excelled in

868
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,440
every single challenge and therefore must be this week's star baker is...

869
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,640
..Jason.

870
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,760
APPLAUSE Well done, mate.

871
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,800
- Thank you.
- Well done!

872
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:01,360
Now we come to the slightly more painful issue of who won't be joining us next week.

873
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,200
The saddest thing of all, of course, is that we have to lose one person.

874
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,400
And I have to say this was extremely close.

875
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,600
And the person who will be leaving us this week is...

876
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,320
..Simon.

877
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,440
I'm so sorry, mate.

878
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,800
It's all right.

879
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,080
No, it's all right.

880
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,560
I don't feel any resentment for the result.

881
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,840
It's got to be the best people go through for this competition.

882
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,400
It is tough. I've told Rob that I expect him

883
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,080
to win, otherwise I'm coming to talk to him afterwards.

884
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,840
- I'm well sorry. 
- Yes, mate. Come here.

885
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,160
For me, Simon just didn't perform all weekend.

886
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,800
It was disappointing today, because his pastry was so overbaked.

887
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,680
Give us a squeeze.

888
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,640
I am upset that I didn't reach the standard that I set myself,

889
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,600
but it will push me to do more in my own baking at home and set a higher standard.

890
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
You're lucky.

891
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,120
For me, Rob, I still feel he shouldn't be here.

892
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,040
But after much talking and chatting, we decided to let him stay.

893
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,400
I want to prove to Mary and Paul that I can be consistently good.

894
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,440
I don't think you've seen the best of me yet at all.

895
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,880
I am enjoying the moment.

896
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,640
This has proven that a lot of the effort that I put in is really paying off, so I am happy.

897
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,040
Obviously I'd had a bad couple of days, so it's such a big relief.

898
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,080
Oh, sorry.

899
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,360
Oh, I'm so relieved.

900
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,320
Next time...

901
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,880
I've got butterflies in my tummy, I'm nervous now.

902
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,040
..it's bread!

903
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,800
It's a bit scary. You just want it to work and you want it to be right.

904
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,120
Paul is on the search for perfection...

905
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,400
This is the week they really have to raise their game.

906
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,560
..setting his first technical challenge - focaccia.

907
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,600
Someone's not been following my recipe.

908
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,040
I think this has been the scariest challenge so far.

909
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,600
The bakers must rise to his exacting standards.

910
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,520
The whole thing's collapsed. It's just gone completely.

911
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,880
Everyone is out to impress.

912
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,520
- You've nailed it. 
- It's a lovely texture, that.

913
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,680
But there can only be one winner.

914
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,040
This is more than a competition.

915
