00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Our search to find Britain's finest amateur baker has taken us on an incredible journey. 

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,640
We have seen airbrushed cakes, we've seen macaroon topiary, 

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,920
we've seen croque-en-bouche skyscrapers. 

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,160
Now there are four bakers remaining. 

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
Welcome to the semi-final of The Great British Bake Off. 

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,360
Last week, the bakers got stuck into desserts. 

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,280
What level of stress? Give me a number between one and ten. 

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,520
- Nine and three quarters. 
- Oh, my lord. 

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
This doesn't count as a roulade. It looks like a disaster area. 

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
Let's face it, I'm just showing off for the judges. 

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,880
- Jo won the Star Baker accolade... 
- THEY APPLAUD 

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,400
- They are to die for. 
- ..and Holly had a narrow escape... 

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,200
It's over-baked, which has make it dry and claggy. 

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,920
..struggling to keep her place in the bake off... 

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm really lucky, REALLY lucky. 

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
..but instead, the judges decided that Yasmin's time was up. 

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
This week, the semi-final... 

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,400
Now I'm feeling hurry-scurry coming on. 

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,440
..and the bakers must demonstrate 

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,160
a variety of new and different skills... 

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,040
- Don't know what has gone on. 
- Can't believe I did that. 

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,640
..including the most sophisticated of all, 

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,800
croissant and Danish pastry dough... 

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
It's blooming hard work. 

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,120
If we don't get through today that's it. We're going home. 

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,400
..but which of these five exceptional home bakers have the talent and passion 

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
to fight for a place in the final of the Great British Bake Off? 

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,120
We're being British and going, "We want everyone to do well," 

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,840
and actually we're all going, "Die, one of you, die!" 

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,400
This week, it's all about patisserie, 

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
which is a French word, roughly translates as, 

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,280
"Oh, I'm going to have to let the waistband out on my trousers." 

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
This competition represents the yin and yang of baking. 

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,440
You've got the bakers inside, sweating nervously, 

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,520
but on the outside you've got two presenters, pleased as Punch, calm as you like, 

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
just waiting to eat the whole lot. 

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,160
Bakers, good morning and welcome. 

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,800
We are one small step away from crowning Britain's best amateur baker. 

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
So we'll kick off with a signature bake 

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,080
and we're asking you to bake a layered mousse cake. 

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,600
Now, how many layers you produce is entirely up to you 

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
and also the filling is entirely up to you. 

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,240
We need the sponge to be light and moist, 

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,920
and we need the filling to be rich and creamy. That's a personal request. 

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,760
You've got two hours on the clock. 

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
On your marks... 

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
- Get set...
- Bake. 

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,920
With a place in the final within their grasp, 

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,920
the bakers know they have to deliver their very best to the judging table, in every challenge. 

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,720
I was panicking before I came in, I was getting really stressed 

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,440
cos it's the semi-final you, sort of, feel the pressure more. 

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,680
Cos I'm thinking so much that my head's too full of thoughts. 

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,120
You're thinking so much that you can't think. 

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
It's really stressful. 

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,040
Patisserie is a term used to describe delicate fancy cakes and pastries. 

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,440
The signature mousse cakes will be judged on their flavour, 

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,880
the bake and how they're layered and decorated. 

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,200
It's more important than ever to meet the expected high standards of the judges, 

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,480
acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood 

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
and distinguished cookery writer and baker, Mary Berry. 

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,840
The sponge must be light and moist, 

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,880
the mousse must be creamy and thick 

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
and then finally, you can't just get away at this stage 

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
bunging a strawberry on the top. 

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,720
It has to have the finesse to finish off a great cake. 

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,440
Right now, they've got to up their game 

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,920
and with the final looming next week 

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,560
I'm expecting exceptional results today. 

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,480
Jo starts by making her sponge mix. 

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
The baked sponge will then form the structural layers of her mousse cake. 

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,600
Hello, Jo. Now, the smell of raspberries is overcoming us all. 

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Tell us exactly what you're doing. 

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm making a Gen... Gen... 

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,800
- Genoese?
- Genoese?
- Genoese sponge and I'm making a raspberry mousse for the middle. 

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,680
You're comfortable with the timing? It's quite tight... 

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,360
And I can see from the look on your face you're saying, "Please go away and leave me in peace!" 

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,200
For Jo, taking part in the bake off represents more than just a chance to indulge one of her hobbies. 

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
'When I got married I was only 17,' 

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,320
so I've never really had a career or anything 

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,800
and it would be nice if I could get the confidence 

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,400
to do something for myself afterwards. 

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,040
I really want to prove to myself that I can do this. 

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
This will be such a major achievement for me. 

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,280
Jo's hoping that her raspberry and strawberry mousse cake, 

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,360
layered with a technically challenging Genoese sponge, 

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,200
will book her a place in the final. 

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,120
The texture of a Genoese sponge is light and delicate 

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,200
and one of the most difficult to pull off. 

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't make these lots at home. It's something quite new to me. 

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240
Unlike a standard sponge, no raising agents are added. 

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,200
Instead, air is beaten into the mixture to create volume. 

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,640
I think there's more pressure because it's so important. 

93
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
If we don't get through today, that's it, we're going home. 

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm certainly feeling it - I just need to grab a bowl, sorry. 

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,040
Definitely a tough challenge, time-wise. 

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
Not long to make something like this. 

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,280
Holly is also making a Genoese sponge. 

98
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,920
However, she's struggling to create the necessary foamy texture. 

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,240
I don't know what has gone on there. 

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
Dreadful. Ergh! 

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,120
I could have got away with it not looking perfect on week one, 

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
but week seven I can't, 

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
and I REALLY would love to be in the final, 

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,320
and I never thought I'd be like this kind of obsessed with it! 

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,640
- THREE!
- Yes, three! Well done. 

106
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,160
Since having children, Holly has taken a break from her career in advertising. 

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,040
- She is a methodical and precise baker.
- That's it. 

108
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,200
'My competitiveness comes out in being quite focused.' 

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
I have to focus when I'm working. 

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,600
'I'm the sort of person who likes to practise,' 

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,840
I know that if I don't practise something it usually will go wrong. 

112
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm not someone who can wing it and I get quite upset if things don't go well. 

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Holly's hoping that her weeks of meticulous planning 

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,600
and baking homework will pay off today 

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,760
with her white chocolate, hazelnut and raspberry Genoese mousse cake. 

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,400
- Hi, Holly.
- Hello.
- So, a Genoese is being made, is it? 

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes, a bit of a disaster, it wasn't doing what it was supposed to. 

118
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
What was going wrong? 

119
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,680
It wasn't rising enough as it was being whisked, 

120
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,520
I thought it was going to be flat if it goes in like that. 

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,120
- You were doing it over hot water?
- Yes. 

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
- Could be the eggs. 
- Not fresh enough?
- Yeah. 

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,760
A fresh egg makes more volume than an egg that you've kept for a long time 

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,280
because the whites go runny. 

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,240
A really fresh egg, when you crack it, the white clings to the yolk. 

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,280
Is your pan still boiling, or has it stopped boiling now? 

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,800
- Still boiling.
- I would just take it off the heat. 

128
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,920
You can over-boil it by putting too much heat underneath. 

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,440
- You only should put it on the least boiling water and that's it.
- Oh, OK. 

130
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,640
It's the first time I've ever made this particular type of sponge. 

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
What it is, it's one without butter. 

132
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,720
I think I probably did make one back in the dark ages, you know. 

133
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,960
In fact, Janet's signature mousse cake is untested. 

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,400
I don't think that's bad, actually. 

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,280
All this practising rubbish... 

136
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,800
looks a bit floppy, doesn't it? 

137
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,480
Shall we cut it in half and give half to you and your mummy? 

138
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Grandmother Janet spent many years living abroad as a language teacher. 

139
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,720
She learned to adapt her baking to whatever ingredients were available. 

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,280
My baking is very haphazard. 

141
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,200
'I dip in the cupboard and if I haven't got enough' 

142
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll find something else to put in... 

143
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
Look out for the train. 

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,600
'..I'm not into, like, to the ounce. 

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,120
'Raymond Blanc would say, "Oh, the last gram matters."' 

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, tough, because I don't do that last gram! 

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,280
Janet has decided to make chocolate amaretto mousse cake 

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,080
with a notable difference. 

149
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,040
So, I'm making a shortbread base, 

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,840
thinking that if I make sponge on the base 

151
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,720
it could all flop when I get it out 

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,560
and then I thought I'll make my mousse, pipe on the mousse 

153
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
and then put a layer of cake, 

154
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,040
brush that with Amaretto liqueur, 

155
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,840
put another layer of mousse, another layer of cake... 

156
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,040
- Chocolate mousse, is it? 
- Chocolate mousse 

157
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,120
- and then the Amaretto liqueur brushed on the...
- In the sponge. 

158
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,920
- Yeah.
- This is a recipe you've been making for some time 

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,840
- with a variation?
- With a variation. 

160
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,720
Experimental baker Mary-Anne 

161
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
once again attempts something unique with her bake. 

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
Instead of baking a cake and cutting it into thin layers, 

163
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm just baking a very thin layer of cake, 

164
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,520
and just to make it a little bit more pretty 

165
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm going to be doing a decor paste pattern in the sponge. 

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,480
Decor paste is made by mixing together unsalted butter, 

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
icing sugar, egg whites, flour and food colouring. 

168
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,240
It's then piped and frozen to set. 

169
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,600
I like doing something that's just a little bit different. 

170
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,080
It'll either work in my favour or against me. 

171
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,640
Sponge batter can then be spread on top without affecting the pattern. 

172
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Can you find the pepper... 

173
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
in the drawer? 

174
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Mary-Anne's passionate about inventing new recipes. 

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,600
She gets her ideas from her vast collection of new 

176
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
and historical recipe books. 

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,040
I've got pushing 700 recipe books 

178
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,440
and if I'm not baking I am reading about baking. 

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,920
'I have no formal qualifications.' 

180
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,280
All I've done is read an awful lot of books 

181
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,160
and I think, "Well, I know which end of a spoon is up," 

182
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
so I have a go - sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not, 

183
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,240
but if it's not so great I've learned something. 

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Her chocolate and orange mousse cake 

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,200
is created with joconde sponge layers. 

186
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,880
This is almost flourless and fatless, 

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,920
making it easy to manipulate for intricate bakes. 

188
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,800
The maverick of the group, Mary-Anne... 

189
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
What I'm fascinated to see, 

190
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,520
she's got orange and chocolate, colours representing the flavours, 

191
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,680
that pattern round the outside is going to be fantastic. 

192
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,120
As long as she manages to set everything in time, 

193
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
it could be a really beautiful thing. 

194
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm thinking simple... 

195
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,920
well executed, 

196
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,320
could, actually, win against fancy, not quite so well finished off. 

197
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
That's what I'm hoping, anyway. 

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,920
OK, there's an hour remaining. Just one hour remaining. 

199
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,480
You're halfway through. 

200
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
For better or worse, here we go. 

201
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,880
SHE LAUGHS 

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,960
It's just not coming up like it does at home. 

203
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
In they go. 

204
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Modern patisserie is a glamorous mix of high-tech design and creativity. 

205
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,040
With dramatic window displays and brightly coloured confectionary, 

206
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,560
this is baking at the highest level. 

207
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,960
The art of patisserie in Britain dates back to the Regency period, 

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,640
in the early 19th century. 

209
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,080
Favoured at the time by international royalty, 

210
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,560
Parisian chef, Marie-Antoine Careme, 

211
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,040
worked for the Prince Regent at the Royal Brighton Pavilion. 

212
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,040
It's a gloriously glamorous period in the history of food 

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
and a period when people are obsessed by food arts, 

214
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,640
by gastronomy, by the glamour of food. 

215
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,000
Careme was a very important innovator. 

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,520
He believed in actually building with food 

217
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,600
and created extraordinary follies, really, hermitages, 

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,160
fallen temples, ruins, made out of pastry and sugar, 

219
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,720
freely mixing all the decorative and architectural styles of the period. 

220
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,000
He wanted to shout, "Patisserie is art, 

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,760
"it's as important as a great building or painting, 

222
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,120
"a great piece of sculpture." 

223
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,280
It's not really the way that he pipes meringue that advances patisserie. 

224
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,040
It's the way he piles up the meringues in the shop window 

225
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
and the carriages stop to look, 

226
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,480
and that was really the key to his fashionability 

227
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,880
and the importance of his patisserie. It was food theatre. 

228
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,760
Cited as an early practitioner of this elaborate style of baking, 

229
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,840
Careme was unique, 

230
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,800
in that he documented his works in highly illustrated books. 

231
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
With these as reference, his artistic approach to patisserie 

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,960
continues to influence the work of patissiers today. 

233
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,600
Modern patisserie, it's all about glamour, sophistication, 

234
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
bringing the dream to the client, 

235
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
showcasing amazing display and, of course, all about the taste. 

236
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,080
In the old days, the clients, 

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,480
the most important thing was what the cake was going to look like. 

238
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,000
They didn't even start to think what it could taste like and that's a huge revolution now. 

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,200
People want the cake or the dessert to taste as good as it looks. 

240
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,760
There is more to patisserie than just making delicious cake. 

241
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,880
It's the whole concept, really, of sophistication and glamour. 

242
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,600
From the Regency kitchens to our modern chic confectioners, 

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,200
patisserie is one area of baking that is a true art form. 

244
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,520
Fab Four, you've got half an hour left. 

245
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,720
30 minutes on the baking clock. 

246
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah, they look nice, and they smell really lovely as well. 

247
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
To be honest, my second sponge isn't brilliant 

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,280
and I feel like I, kind of, already know what's going to happen. 

249
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm just really, really upset with myself. 

250
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, well done. 
- It's a nice effect. 

251
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm actually going to cut a strip of this 

252
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,080
and use it to line a spring-form pan 

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,560
- and then cut another circle and use that as the base...
- Yeah. 

254
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
..and then put the mousse in and have another circle 

255
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,160
- with the pattern showing on the top. 
- A 360 pattern.
- Fantastic.
- Thank you. 

256
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,440
- It's brilliant - it's a cake and a children's activity centre! Perfect.
- Thanks. 

257
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,400
I am now painting the sponges 

258
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,680
with some highly alcoholic hazelnut liqueur, which is delicious. 

259
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
I'm just going to drizzle in some framboise, 

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,720
which is a raspberry liqueur, just a little bit of a taste, that's all. 

261
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,320
Time is ticking away. 

262
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,440
The bakers must make their mousse 

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,680
so they can start to construct their layered cakes. 

264
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,000
It's called iced chocolate Amaretto mousse. 

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,080
Everybody loves it, 

266
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,560
so, you can't go wrong if you make something people like, can you? 

267
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,640
Mousse is made by mixing the baker's chosen flavour with cream, sugar 

268
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,320
and then thickened with either beaten egg whites or gelatine. 

269
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,080
The mousse must be light and airy, 

270
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,600
but strong enough to support the sponge layers. 

271
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,080
Really, it is quite nerve racking! 

272
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,400
The only thing you can do 

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,280
is strengthen it with support of fruit round the outside 

274
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,120
to prevent that two layers on top concertinaing the sponge, 

275
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
so standing up fruit round the outside is a bit of a tip. 

276
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,440
This is the praline crumb. 

277
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
It didn't go brilliantly well at the start, 

278
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,920
but I think I've brought it back. 

279
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,880
The problem for me is that I have in my mind 

280
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,360
something which is not the reality. 

281
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,920
Make it up as you go along, really. 

282
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,840
With time running out, Mary-Anne has made a crucial mistake. 

283
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,600
I've put the sponge the wrong way round on half of it. 

284
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I can't believe I did that. 

285
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,320
Bakers, the end is almost nigh. 

286
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,960
You've got 60 seconds left. 

287
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,240
They're leaning slightly. 

288
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,280
- Just don't say.
- OK. 
- I reckon they won't even... 

289
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,560
- (They'll never know.)
- No. 

290
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Bakers, time is very much up now. 

291
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,160
There is a mousse loose aboot this hoose! 

292
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
- And we're going to eat it.
- Yup. 

293
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,360
Mary and Paul's critique of the layered mousse cakes 

294
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,440
is crucial to the bakers' chances of making the grand final. 

295
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,240
Very nice. 

296
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,600
It's set well. 

297
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
I mean, it's set really well. 

298
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,120
Looks good, I think I would have liked another layer of sponge. 

299
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,840
The ratio to mousse, 

300
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,560
it should be equal and we've got much more mousse. 

301
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,680
A tad over generous. 

302
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,360
- It tastes lovely.
- Mm. 
- It really does. 

303
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Very clever idea to put the shortbread. 

304
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,920
- I thought it would be too thick, it isn't at all too thick.
- No. 

305
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,560
I think the overall appearance, it needed to be more polished, 

306
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
but the flavours are great. 

307
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,440
- Good.
- It's really nice. 
- Good. OK, thank you.
- Well done. 

308
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,560
I think your Genoese, it's a little bit dry, but the flavour's great. 

309
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,800
- I think the praline's superb. 
- The praline is excellent. 

310
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,120
I'm just debating whether it would have worked more as a flatter cake 

311
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,320
with less weight, with more mousse because the flavour of that mousse is fantastic. 

312
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,800
And also, I would have liked to see a raspberry glaze over the top. 

313
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,640
It doesn't look finished to me. 

314
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,960
The strawberries, although they're magnificent, 

315
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
- they're too big...
- Yes. 
- ..for the cake. 

316
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,920
- They will not give you the stability that you're looking for.
- Yes. 

317
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,000
If you halve a small one, it would give you the stability 

318
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,360
cos it would have the edge. 

319
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,000
- Thinner, structured layers would have been nicer than one big fat one.
- Mm. 

320
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,720
The Genoese is too dry. 

321
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
You must have lost a bit of height. 

322
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
The mousse mixture, if you look carefully there are lumps of white, 

323
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,440
but as we walked up to it, it certainly looked stunning. 

324
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,080
- You wouldn't miss that on a tea table, would you?
- No. 

325
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,480
- Oh.
- What happened to the other side? 

326
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,440
Erm... We have beauty on the inside! 

327
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,400
It's not just that I put it the wrong way round, no, no. 

328
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,800
- I personally think this looks great. 
- The mousse is very good. 

329
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,280
Your sponge is baked well, it's very, very light 

330
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,080
and I think you've done a... I think you've done a really good job. 

331
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,400
- You've shown us so many skills. 
- Thank you.
- Well done!
- Thank you. 

332
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,360
Yes, they really liked it, 

333
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,880
I'm really pleased that despite my gaffe, they enjoyed it. 

334
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
They liked the flavour, actually. 

335
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,640
I was pleased that they liked the Amaretto that was coming through the sponge, 

336
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,560
that they liked the shortbread base, which was still nice and crispy. 

337
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,640
So, it wasn't all bad at all, you know. 

338
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,400
I thought that looked really good. They didn't. 

339
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,040
That's quite difficult, now, 

340
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,880
because I just don't have that standard they want. 

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm a bit disappointed about the comments, obviously they weren't the best. 

342
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,440
So I'll have to just try a bit harder this afternoon. 

343
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,960
With only three places in the final up for grabs, 

344
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,880
the bakers now face the challenge they all fear... 

345
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,320
the technical. 

346
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,400
There is no time to prepare, 

347
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,160
as the recipe is only revealed at the start of the timed challenge. 

348
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,520
Today's technical challenge is one of my all-time favourites. 

349
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,960
Iced fingers. 

350
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,840
Indeed, and not just any iced fingers. 

351
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,960
These are Paul Hollywood's own iced fingers. OK? 

352
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,640
So we need 12 identical fingers. 

353
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,440
We want them filled with cream and jam 

354
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,320
and, as always, this one is going to be judged blind, 

355
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,040
so Paul and Mary, I'm going to ask you if you'd mind leaving the tent. 

356
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,680
- So please, on your marks, get set, bake.
- Bake. 

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,560
All four bakers have been given the same ingredients. 

358
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,840
The judges have stripped back the recipe 

359
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,000
to put their knowledge and skill to the test. 

360
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Never in my life have I made an iced bun. 

361
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,640
It's not a thing I'd be yearning to make normally, 

362
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,080
but, you know, I might be converted. 

363
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm sure Mary and Paul must have had some sort of spy camera on me all my life 

364
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,760
and just doing everything that I've never made before. 

365
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,960
No, I've never made iced buns before, 

366
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,000
mind you, I'd never made pork pies before and I got second in that, so... 

367
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,840
it's all to play for. 

368
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,760
The iced finger dough the bakers are working with 

369
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,920
contains the additional ingredients of milk and sugar, 

370
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,120
which gives the fingers a richer taste, 

371
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,200
but these make the dough respond differently when being shaped and baked. 

372
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
What I've learned from technical bakes 

373
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,160
is don't mess with the instructions or ingredients, just do what it says. 

374
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
Follow the rules. 

375
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,760
Obviously you've got to get the dough really good 

376
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,960
and get the elasticity and everything. 

377
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Oh, I'm not really great at the technical. 

378
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,200
I know roughly how things should feel, 

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
but I don't know the physics of everything. 

380
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,600
Kneading stretches the gluten strands 

381
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,120
created by mixing the flour and water together. 

382
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,800
If the bakers cut short this process, the fingers will not rise properly. 

383
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm not 100% sure how he wants them to look at the end, 

384
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,080
which is always tricky in the technical. 

385
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,000
I've got an image in MY mind. 

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,840
Whether that's what's in Paul's mind... 

387
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,760
Now, there are several criteria I'll be looking for. 

388
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,520
The first thing is the colour of the bun, it has to be cooked properly. 

389
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,480
The second thing is the shape - all even, all the same size. 

390
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
The icing must be perfect 

391
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
and the texture of that bun must be lovely and soft. 

392
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,680
Consistency is what they look for, especially in the batches and they want 12. 

393
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,800
And when the judges ask for a batch 

394
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,000
they want consistency across the batch... 

395
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
..which is why I'm taking the time to make sure 

396
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,640
that the dough is approximately the same weight, 

397
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,160
about 85 grams in each one. 

398
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,960
What are a few grams? But they will make a difference. 

399
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,160
I just know he's going to have his eagle eye 

400
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,960
looking for unequal looking buns. 

401
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,040
(It's very quiet, isn't it?) 

402
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,960
It's because the competition is now insanely intense. 

403
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,680
- Have you all talked about... 
- No.
- ..openly? 

404
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,640
We're being really British and going, 

405
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,680
"No, we all want everyone to do so well," 

406
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,520
and actually we're all going, "Die, one of you, die!", you know. 

407
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,960
So, it literally is very much the British bake off, isn't it? 

408
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,920
- It so is.
- It's so British.
- So is. 

409
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
All these mums going, "Oh, I just want everyone to do well." 

410
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,680
No, you don't. 

411
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,480
You want someone to leave. 

412
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,640
MEL TITTERS 

413
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,600
The shaped fingers go into the proving drawer. 

414
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,400
The warm temperature accelerates the activity of the yeast. 

415
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,920
This fermentation process produces carbon dioxide, 

416
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,960
which should puff the fingers up to double their size. 

417
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,000
They're not looking very high, you know. 

418
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,480
I can't even remember what they're supposed to look like any more. 

419
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
You know, you sort of buy one, don't you, 

420
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,720
and you don't examine it really for height and width, so... 

421
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,680
just going to have to hope they're OK. 

422
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,520
OK, you're halfway through. 

423
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,080
Never having made them before, 

424
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,760
I don't know how much these are going to rise, 

425
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,200
so I don't know if I've got them spaced far enough apart. 

426
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, you've just got to go for it at some stage. 

427
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
For better or worse, get in and cook. 

428
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,640
A perfect iced finger should be soft, light and airy. 

429
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,560
Under-baked and they will be too doughy in the middle... 

430
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,240
- (Oh, look at those.) 
- Have to turn them round. 

431
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,880
You see the end ones are getting a little bit burned. 

432
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,280
How long have they been in? They need two more minutes, officially. 

433
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,640
Over-baked and the batch will become tough and crispy. 

434
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,120
- A good dollop of icing will cover a multitude of sins.
- Good. 

435
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,400
Some are slightly darker than the others. 

436
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
They're nice and light. 

437
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,840
- Oh!
- They're not very dainty. 

438
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,000
- Iced fingers aren't supposed to be dainty!
- Oh, right. 

439
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,800
You've got to stuff your face with them. Look at that, the way it rips apart. 

440
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm salivating really badly. 

441
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,440
Actually, they look OK. I'm actually quite happy with that. 

442
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,920
15 minutes, Bake Off queens, for your icing and slicing. 

443
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,280
Oops! The pips keep blocking up the nozzle, 

444
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,800
so I'm going to try sieving it a bit. 

445
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,200
I wasn't going to sieve it and then... 

446
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,360
actually sat too long, watched everybody else and decided to. 

447
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't want to take any risks. 

448
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh! 

449
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,280
Gosh, blooming hard work! 

450
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,080
Now, to put the icing on top of the fingers you use the dip technique, 

451
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,560
which is literally just dip in, run your finger across the top 

452
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
and then leave it to set. 

453
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,120
- That's what I'd call water icing... 
- A water icing, yes. 

454
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,880
- ..a simple icing sugar and water. 
- That's right. 

455
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,320
- So this was Paul's way. 
- Yes.
- This is dipping. 

456
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,240
This is dipping. I don't like the dipped look. 

457
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,120
I lost half of it on the table where it all dripped down. 

458
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
I'll try and tidy this up a little. 

459
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,240
I didn't trust myself to be able to dip into a thick paste, 

460
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,080
so I thought I would put a line of icing across the top. 

461
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,320
I'm quite good at making things look the same, 

462
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,400
so even if they don't taste that good 

463
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,880
I hope I'll get a couple of points for the fact they look similar. 

464
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,480
I want to do the best icing I can, so I'm sort of smearing it. 

465
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,240
- Boutique feminisation about to occur. 
- Oh, I don't know, ooh. 

466
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,440
A slight sense of, sort of, scar tissue, isn't there, with it? MARY-ANNE LAUGHS  

467
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,640
- What you've done basically is you've made Frankenstein's buns.
- Yes. 

468
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,040
Bakerettes, you've got 60 seconds left on the clock. 

469
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
OK, fingers to the ends of benches. 

470
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,240
Time up. 

471
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,200
They're done, for better or worse. 

472
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,880
Mary and Paul always judge the technical bake blind. 

473
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,840
They have no idea which batch belongs to which baker. 

474
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,440
- Gosh. Don't they look good? 
- I'm pleasantly surprised. 

475
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,920
They're a pretty even batch across the field. 

476
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,720
They do smell very, very good, all of them. 

477
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
The texture's good. 

478
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,760
It's soft, it's got an equal colour. 

479
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,640
The icing hasn't covered the whole top, but the idea is nice. 

480
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,720
It's got a nice taste, hasn't it? 

481
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,400
- Mm.
- It's very, very good. 
- Absolutely delicious. 

482
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,640
And it's SO soft. 

483
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,040
- Nice amount of jam.
- The only thing I'd say was it needs more cream. 

484
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,280
There is not enough cream in there. OK, let's move on to this one. 

485
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,920
This one looks a little bit paler, a little bit fat. 

486
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,640
There's a dough line that's running along the bottom, 

487
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,240
which needed another couple of minutes. It's not quite done inside. 

488
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
A bit tight at the bottom, isn't it? 

489
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,720
The icing's nice enough. 

490
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,280
The cream and jam's good. 

491
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,880
It's a fairly uniform shape, 

492
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
but it's the bake that's let that one down. 

493
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,800
Now, this one, it's got more of a uniform icing on it, 

494
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,080
although the icing was a little bit too wet, 

495
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,480
that's why it's run down the side. 

496
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,720
That's got a good bake, that one. It's nice and soft. 

497
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,800
The texture's good. Some of them are a bit irregular. 

498
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,240
- They all have to be the same size. OK?
- Mm. 

499
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,560
These are nice, good even bake. Icing's not bad. 

500
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,840
- Quite nice, this zigzag...
- Perfect size.
- ..finish here, isn't it? 

501
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,080
It's got a nice finish, bit of arty flair. 

502
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,200
Just done. Another minute too less they wouldn't have been baked. As it is, they're baked fine. 

503
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,080
These are far nicer than any... 

504
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
..Shop bought ones. 

505
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,480
Yes. I've never had such delicious ones. They really are good. 

506
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,200
- Lovely and buttery. 
- I think you've all done really well. 

507
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,240
You should be very proud of yourselves. 

508
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,760
That was the doughy one. 

509
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,280
The judges must now make their final deliberation. 

510
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,760
These two were good. 

511
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,240
Two, three, four. 

512
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,040
In fourth is this one here. 

513
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,160
They were not quite done at the bottom. 

514
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,960
In third place, we've gone for this one. 

515
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
- Me.
- Normally you dip in and then run your finger along it. 

516
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,920
They would have been fantastic. The flavour was very good, but it's purely 

517
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,560
based on aesthetics with this one. 

518
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,960
And number two, a little bit of originality with the jam, 

519
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,000
absolutely delicious. 

520
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,920
And that leaves Holly, number one. These are a great iced finger. 

521
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,360
The bake, the colour, the texture, 

522
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,400
- the flavour, it was all there. Well done.
- Well done, all of you. 

523
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,000
- Well done, everyone.
- Yay! 

524
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,520
'I'm really, really pleased.' 

525
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,880
I really needed that after this morning. 

526
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,080
I feel like I'm back on a level playing field 

527
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,280
in an average position, because this morning didn't go so well. 

528
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,360
I needed to do well this afternoon. I also need to do well tomorrow as well. 

529
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,560
'It was a bit disappointing, you know, because I thought I'd done OK.' 

530
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,640
I'm going to have to pull out all the stops tomorrow, I think. 

531
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,440
'Could have been worse.' 

532
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,040
I could have been bottom. 

533
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,120
But, hey. Bring on tomorrow. 

534
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,640
It's the showstopper, and the bakers' last chance to prove they're worthy of one of the three places 

535
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,840
in the Great British Bake Off final. 

536
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,400
Here we are, halfway through the semi-final. 

537
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,840
- Who's in danger, who's looking good? 
- I think Mary-Anne has come up and up. 

538
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,320
Her cake was so professional. 

539
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,680
Holly, I didn't much like her mousse cake, 

540
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,000
and then in the iced buns she won, so she's picked herself up slightly. 

541
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,560
Janet's failed on the iced bun, but her cake was fantastic. 

542
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,600
- So, again, she's got it all to play for.
- Let's move on to Jo. 

543
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,200
- She's in serious trouble. 
- Her cake didn't have the finish. 

544
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,520
She had a cream filling but there were lumps of unmixed cream in it. 

545
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,440
But then you look at the iced bun challenge and I think she was second from bottom in that one as well, 

546
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,560
so at the moment, Mary-Anne's fairly safe, but Holly, Janet and Jo are all in the danger zone. 

547
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,120
Your showstopper challenge this week, ladies, we'd like you to make, please, a selection of pastries. 

548
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,640
Danish pastries, pain au chocolat, or your simple 

549
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,280
all-butter croissant, but we'd like you to make all the pastries, please, out of the same dough. 

550
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,320
And that dough, when put in the oven, needs to be crispy and golden on the outside 

551
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,800
and it needs to be soft and buttery on the inside. 

552
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,320
And you'll know, as experienced home bakers, that this process takes a long time. 

553
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,800
So, bakers, on your marks, 

554
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,400
- get set...
- Bake. 

555
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,200
The bakers are producing three different types of pastries, all to be made from the same dough. 

556
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,920
This dough, known as layered or laminated pastry, 

557
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,120
is labour-intensive and technically demanding. 

558
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,360
It's created by repeatedly rolling and folding alternate layers of butter and dough. 

559
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,560
This particular showstopper is, for me, the hardest one we've had so far. 

560
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,560
You have to make your dough, you have to fold the dough, 

561
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,000
you have to choose your shape, you have to roll it out to a perfect level, 

562
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,160
then you have to choose your filling, then prove and bake. 

563
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,480
It's difficult to get to perfection. It's all about the stages. 

564
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm looking for some unusual shapes and a very professional finish. 

565
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,880
They should be well risen, a lovely golden brown, 

566
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,360
so they've got to look right, they've got to taste really special. 

567
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:44,320
First they make their dough, a classic sweet bread dough made from flour, yeast, salt, sugar and water. 

568
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,280
This is kneaded until elastic. 

569
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,480
It could all go wrong at any point, really. 

570
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,720
I mean, this probably is the most essential bit. 

571
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,960
To get the base of the dough, you've got to have a good foundation to then have a good pastry. 

572
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,320
Jo is making a classic pain aux raisins, chocolate twists 

573
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,560
and her own original invention, a banana and raisin pastry. 

574
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,040
The banana and raisin, how are you putting that into the Danish? As a pain aux raisins style? 

575
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,760
- As a, you know, the folded one... 
- Oh, right, got you. 

576
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,800
- The square with the bits folded in. 
- Yeah. Mm.
- Fantastic. 

577
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,880
I think banana and raisin works a treat. 

578
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,480
I've never had a banana and raisin one before. 

579
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,680
I've had an apple and raisin one. 

580
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,960
I adapted it with a banana because I thought that might be quite nice. 

581
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,160
- What yeast did you use in your...? - I used the fast action. 

582
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,400
- We've learnt which Paul liked best. - It's a good tip for me. 

583
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,160
The bakers now need to introduce a layer of butter into their bread dough. 

584
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
Are you having that as well? 

585
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,840
Yeah, it has to have a pound of butter. 

586
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
Oh, my... 

587
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,040
This is an obscene amount of butter! 

588
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,280
The dough is wrapped around the slab of butter. 

589
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,360
This is the way I do it. Just get it into a block and then you make sure that every bit of pastry has got 

590
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,000
the same amount of butter in it, and the same amount of layers. 

591
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
The bakers then roll the pastry out. 

592
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,720
You don't want the butter to start melting 

593
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,840
and you want to keep it quite firm because it'll then stay in layers when you fold it. 

594
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,520
If it starts warming up, it will sort of ooze out of the edges. 

595
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,680
Next it is folded... 

596
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,400
covered with cling wrap... 

597
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,840
and left to rest in the fridge. 

598
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,400
This process is repeated at least three times over four hours to create the layers. 

599
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,280
I've never made croissants or Danish pastries before 

600
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,440
and I think it's such a laborious process. 

601
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,600
If someone else can make something better than you can then you should probably buy it. 

602
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,960
Holly is making apricot, macadamia and white chocolate pinwheels, 

603
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,920
almond croissants and apple, raisin and cinnamon plaits. 

604
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,840
- How's it going?
- Not too bad. 

605
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,280
I can tell when you look at this in particular, now what you're looking for is a marble, and you can see 

606
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,280
the marble in there, which is an indication of a decent dough. 

607
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
The dough now needs to prove in the fridge for 12 hours. 

608
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,920
The cold temperature allows the gluten to relax while the yeast causes the dough to rise. 

609
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,920
The croissant. It's about as Francais as striking, smoking and randomly shrugging. 

610
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,320
Bouf! Ah, mais non. In fact, the mythology and history of the croissant 

611
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,320
is as rich, multi-layered and intriguing as the pastry itself. 

612
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,440
What we do know for sure is that the croissant 

613
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,720
is not French. Sweet pastry was brought back to medieval Europe 

614
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,960
from the Middle East by soldiers returning from the Crusades, 

615
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,960
and croissant-like pastries were being consumed in Austria 

616
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,880
long before there is any record of their arrival in France. 

617
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,840
According to one legend, the story of the croissant began in Vienna in 1683. 

618
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,920
Some bakers, working through the night, heard digging, 

619
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,360
and Turks were discovered trying to tunnel under the city wall. 

620
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,480
In honour of this, a pastry was created to represent the crescent on the Turkish flag 

621
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,200
and named the kipferl, meaning crescent. 

622
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,000
In the late 1830s, the Boulangerie Viennoise opened in Paris and began 

623
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,600
selling kipferl, which quickly adopted the French equivalent name of croissant, also meaning crescent. 

624
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,760
Around the turn of the 20th century, it evolved from the brioche style 

625
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
dough of the kipferl into the light puff pastry we know today. 

626
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,160
Since then, we've added almonds, chocolate, even cheese, 

627
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,520
all 20th-century additions to the original. 

628
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,800
Whatever the truth about their origins, croissants have been sold and baked here 

629
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,760
in Paris since the middle of the 19th century, where they sold 

630
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,200
like hot pastries to members of the aristocracy, 

631
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,000
and one of the first places to bake them was right here, in the heart of the city. 

632
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,160
The same amount of pastry, fifty-fifty. 

633
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,520
'Although the rolling is now done by machines, this part of the process used to be a gruelling task, 

634
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,720
'with French patissier chefs hand rolling large volumes of dough until thin sheets of pastry were formed. 

635
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,400
'Still today, the most difficult part of the process is done by hand.' 

636
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,680
And I'm going to do it in six seconds. 

637
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,920
So I'm thinking you stretch it, and that's going to break in a minute. 

638
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
- And then...
- Then you roll. 
- Roll it. 

639
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,600
This is the fattest croissant that ever was. 

640
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,160
This is a British croissant. 

641
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,320
I think we've found out that when it comes to this particular pastry, 

642
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,240
it's very much England nil, France 1. Well done, you lot. 

643
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,640
I'm very sad to see my croissants aren't there. Very sad. But these are yours. Let's try them. 

644
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,880
- OK.
- Mm. 

645
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,120
Mm. It's the best. 

646
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,880
- So you do speak English?
- Only that. 

647
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,680
While the dough is still resting in the fridge, the bakers begin to prepare their fillings. 

648
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm just making the caramelised bananas there for my topping, 

649
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,240
and creme patissiere for my pain aux raisins and my chocolate twists. 

650
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,840
That's looking nice now. That's just how it should be. 

651
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,360
Beautiful. 

652
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,960
Creme patissiere is a classic French custard filling, stabilised with flour. 

653
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,600
It's technically challenging, as the mix needs to come off the heat at exactly the right moment. 

654
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,520
Too thick, it becomes claggy when baked. Too loose and it will leak out of the pastry. 

655
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,960
I wish this stuff would hurry up and thicken. 

656
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm stirring it quite carefully, and I don't want a pan of scrambled eggs. 

657
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,800
It's just using a lot of time, but if I don't do it I don't have 

658
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,320
pain aux raisins, so it's Hobson's Choice, really. 

659
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,160
Janet is going for the classic French trio - 

660
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,320
together with pain aux raisins, she's also baking plain croissants and pain au chocolat. 

661
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,440
You've got creme patissiere in there and you're being very careful to keep it at a low temperature. 

662
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,840
- Yes.
- The essential thing is not to overheat it and to stir all the time.
- Yes, that's right, yes. 

663
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,000
Because if you over-cook it, you'll get a very nasty texture. 

664
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
I'm quite sure you're not going to do that. 

665
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,400
No. That's why I took it off the thing while we're talking. 

666
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,360
I prefer savoury things over sweet things and although I think the two 

667
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,720
sweet flavours I've got lined up are really nice, I wanted one for me. 

668
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,240
For her pastries, Mary-Anne's creating raspberry rose Danishes, 

669
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,360
praline spirals and also savoury Alsatian plaited Danishes. 

670
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,440
- Hello. 
- Hi, Mary-Anne.
- Mary-Anne. 

671
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,680
- Hi.
- Now, Mary-Anne, you're the only one to do a savoury Danish pastry. 

672
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,160
Yeah. It comes from the Alsace region of France. 

673
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:47,120
They make a kind of pizza, usually with very thin bread dough and a bit of creme fraiche, onion, bacon 

674
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,040
and goats' cheese, so I thought I'd take that and transfer it to the filling of a Danish pastry. 

675
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,760
It's interesting. I am really looking forward to this. 

676
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
That's a bit of a "could be good, could be bad" when Paul says "interesting". 

677
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,160
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much. 
- Go for it. See you later.
- Thank you. 

678
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,840
She certainly is the one who always experiments and pushes the boat out, 

679
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,280
- and usually it works.
- Yes. 

680
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,440
I could look at the fillings and go no, no, no, don't like that, don't like that. 

681
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,920
But Mary-Anne's surprised me in the past, so I'm reserving judgment 

682
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,880
because I've never heard of those fillings before. 

683
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,480
I just expect to be wowed. 

684
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,240
OK, there's an hour remaining, bakers. 

685
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,440
The chilled doughs finally come out. 

686
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,560
While in the fridge, the dough has also been proving and should be double in size. 

687
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,000
Could have been a bit puffier, but I did wrap it quite tightly because the two times that I've practised 

688
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,600
this dough, it's burst out of the Clingwrap and it's dried out where it's been exposed to the air in 

689
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,320
the refrigerator, so I really didn't want that to happen, so wrapped it 

690
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,240
quite tightly and that might have constricted it a bit. 

691
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm just going to cut it into 

692
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,920
three so that I know what I've got for each section of pastry. 

693
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,800
To make a croissant, the dough needs to be cut into a triangular shape. 

694
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,160
I looked up on the internet what the size should be and then I tried a few different sizes 

695
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,080
and decided that 28 centimetres long by 12 centimetres across was the optimum size. 

696
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,760
I've practised the shaping quite a bit at home because it's quite hard to do, frankly. 

697
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,360
So I wanted to sort of prove I could make a croissant, but it's not easy. 

698
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,040
Come on. Don't let me down. 

699
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:46,000
I rolled mine up and I don't know whether they were too wide for the length or something. 

700
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,440
Anyhow, they're proving to be a disaster. 

701
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,120
They're not very well shaped. 

702
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,520
You know, I'm looking at Holly's and I wish I hadn't looked. 

703
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,480
45 minutes to go. The bakers shape and fill their pastries. 

704
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,920
Really, these three pastries are the embodiment of the bake off 

705
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,120
to me because the raspberry rose one reminds me of Mary because it's pink and delicate, 

706
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,240
and then I've done praline because of Paul, who said last week he quite liked it. 

707
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,000
Shameless attempt to curry favour with the judges. 

708
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,960
Janet, I've been admiring your buns from afar and, quite frankly, they're so large, 

709
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,920
you can be at any point in the tent and be aware of their beauty. 

710
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,960
- I mean, look at that. That's a lovely bit of pastry. 
- I really hope they'll be nice. 

711
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,720
They probably should have been an inch wide, but I thought, what the hell, I might as well use the lot. 

712
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,200
OK, this is your Danish countdown, 25 minutes remaining. 

713
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,880
At home, I might leave them to rise a little more, but I just don't have time. 

714
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,120
The pastries start to go into the oven. 

715
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,040
Pray and behave yourself. 

716
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,880
However, varying bake times due to the different fillings 

717
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,120
means that the bakers now face a very tricky, staggered and finely balanced last hurdle. 

718
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
'I don't feel too confident at all.' 

719
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,720
Janet's going for the classic French trinity, I think. 

720
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,640
Looking at what she's doing currently with the pains au chocolat, 

721
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,200
they're going to be from the Land of the Giants. 

722
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,000
- They're going to be huge, aren't they?
- They'll be colossal. 

723
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,160
I think all of them at the moment have come up with some great flavours. 

724
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,840
Some, for me, I'm more attracted to than others, 

725
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,040
- but it's all about baking now. That's the crucial bit.
- Yeah. 

726
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,160
Getting better done the other way round. 

727
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,680
I'm just hoping they're cooked all the way through because that's been my major issue with them at home. 

728
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,720
That one's unravelled. That's not good. 

729
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,720
Just give them a couple of minutes more, you know. 

730
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,240
Don't want them to say, "Mm, doughy!" 

731
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,280
Bit to go yet. 

732
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,640
I'm not cutting it fine at all! 

733
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,360
Obviously, when there's so many different components, there's sugar 

734
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,240
in all of them, so you don't want to over-sweeten anything, 

735
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,640
but then you don't want it to taste bland either. It's really... it's quite nerve racking. 

736
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,560
OK, that's one minute remaining. 

737
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,080
That's it. Done. 

738
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,320
OK, that's time up. The baked French goods to the end of your benches, please. Thank you. 

739
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,600
The semi-finalists have endured seven weeks and 21 demanding bakes. 

740
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,880
Their fate now rests on the judging of this showstopper. 

741
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,440
OK, Holly, you're up first. 

742
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,000
They look so professional, all evenly brown. Don't they look lovely? 

743
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,120
I think they look absolutely stunning. 

744
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:10,000
I think they really do. The lamination on the Catherine wheel, it just hasn't done it inside. 

745
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,120
You can see a couple of the layers where they haven't baked. 

746
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,720
It's probably down to you. The oven's been slightly too hot. 

747
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,160
The croissant especially is difficult to make with almond inside it. 

748
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,360
You can see you've got a beautiful structure inside. These are really tricky to make properly. 

749
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,000
Lovely. Really nice. 

750
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,720
So buttery and light. 

751
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,080
I like the apricot ones. 

752
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,520
The apricot is strong. Each one of those 

753
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,400
is beautifully neat. I should have been standing over you to learn how to do that. 

754
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,040
- It really is beautiful. - There was a ruler involved. 

755
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,880
- I saw it. - I missed out on that. 

756
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,800
It was like a geometry lesson. 

757
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:50,560
I kid you not, they are great specimens of pastries. Well done. 

758
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,040
Well done, Holly. 

759
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,960
So, Janet. 

760
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,040
Gosh, that's a basket of bounty, isn't it? 

761
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,080
I'm afraid, excessively large. 

762
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,600
How many do these feed? 

763
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,920
- A hungry person. 
- The croissant is a poor shape. 

764
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,120
- Yes, I know.
- The top of your triangle has to be about four or five inches. 

765
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,400
The bottom, you can take down to 12 inches. 

766
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,800
What you then do is roll it all up and that gives you the layers. 

767
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,120
What's happened is that you've basically got quite a fat triangle and you've rolled it up 

768
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,120
- and it's quite thick. 
- Yeah, I didn't know how much one could handle the pastry, you know. 

769
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,560
This one looks great. It's just massive. 

770
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,920
Cutting your Catherine wheel, it's lovely and spongy. 

771
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,080
I could have done with a little more fruit in here. 

772
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,880
Did you over-cook your creme patissiere? 

773
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,400
It was thick, spreadable. 

774
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,160
- It's thickened up too much. Stodgy. 
- Oh, sorry. 

775
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,760
It's very difficult because it's bound to thicken up with the intensely hot oven. 

776
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,480
The bake on those are OK. The lamination is fantastic. 

777
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,680
The flavour's good on all of them. It's down to the shape. 

778
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,000
- That is purely your downfall, the shape.
- Yeah, I know. 
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you. 

779
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,320
Well done, Janet. 

780
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,040
Mary-Anne. 

781
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,200
This is more the savoury style of things, savoury meets sweet. 

782
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,120
They haven't quite cooked properly. 

783
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,640
They're quite raw inside. 

784
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,280
- Yeah.
- Which is a bit of a shame. This is the rose, isn't it? 

785
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,440
Mm. Raspberry and rose. 

786
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,320
The moment you get your nose there, it's roses. 

787
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,960
- That's amazing how you got that through.
- Isn't it? 
- And it's delicate as well. 

788
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,520
- This is bacon, caramelised onion and goats' cheese?
- Yes. 

789
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,080
- It's a nice idea. The flavours are great.
- Tastes good. 

790
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,080
I am getting the crisp, it's just slightly underdone inside. 

791
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,880
It's very sad about your sort of Catherine wheel. 

792
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,600
- It's sort of come open.
- It's very difficult with that amount of paste, 

793
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,120
though, to bind. It'll never do it in a million years, 

794
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,240
because of the amount of filling. I mean, at the end of the day, 

795
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,000
- it's down to the bake.
- Yeah. 
- It's down to the finish 

796
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,080
and the bake that was lacking on this one. Some of the flavours 

797
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,440
that you got are unique and have worked, 

798
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,640
- but it's down to the bake itself. Thanks very much.
- OK. Thank you. 

799
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,800
Well done, well done. 

800
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,600
I think they all look fantastic. 

801
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,640
- Thank you. 
- They just look so tempting. 

802
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,880
And they're so lovely and shiny and polished, aren't they? 

803
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,960
- I can tell you now, from the structure, they are fantastic.
- Oh, thank you. 

804
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,440
The structure is absolutely spot-on. 

805
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,960
It's crunchy, done just as brown underneath as it on top. 

806
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,880
That pain aux raisins is delicious. You've got a crispy outside, golden brown, you've decorated it 

807
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,560
with the jam, you spun some icing sugar on it as well. 

808
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,120
And the texture, the flake inside, 

809
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,440
is impressive. 

810
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,560
- I'm gobsmacked. I really am. I think they're lovely. 
- They really are very good, Jo. 

811
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,080
- Well done.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Jo. 

812
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,000
- Thank you.
- Well done, Jo. 

813
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,800
If I hear the words "I'm through", it'll be better than what Paul's just said to me 

814
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,360
just now, with my bakes, and that was pretty awesome. 

815
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,840
I just really hope that I'm now in for next week 

816
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,160
and I hope that my mousse cake doesn't go too much against me. 

817
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,960
So it wasn't the best feedback ever. 

818
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,400
Could I have blown it at the last fence? Who knows? I don't know. 

819
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,840
There's a time for everyone to go, 

820
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,840
and for me in this competition, today might be that day. 

821
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:38,280
Paul and Mary must now look back over the bakes to decide who will miss out on the grand final. 

822
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,120
So, Paul and Mary, before you are the 12 clinchers to decide 

823
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,200
who is going to go through to the final. 

824
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,000
I mean, Jo, I thought her cake yesterday was very weak. It wasn't sweet enough. 

825
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,880
Structurally it wasn't sound, and you look at 

826
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,600
the iced bun challenge, she was second from bottom. 

827
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,200
- But today...
- Just so good. She was the only one to get the pinwheel right. 

828
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,480
Jo has created a miracle. 

829
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,000
Only something of that quality could save her. 

830
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,760
- And then Holly.
- This week, although her layered mousse cake was all right, it wasn't spectacular 

831
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,120
and I'd certainly put it in second from bottom. 

832
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,480
But, with her pastries today, I think she could be saved. 

833
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,400
Where do you stand on Janet? 

834
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,000
Janet yesterday, I quite liked her layered cake. 

835
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,640
- She came bottom in the iced buns. 
- She came bottom, 

836
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,800
and again, today, she struggled a bit with the pastries. 

837
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,560
They really are huge. 

838
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,840
That croissant's more like a neck support. 

839
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,480
It's a shame, because the flavour of the pastry is OK. 

840
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,040
Mary-Anne yesterday, she did that very beautiful cake with the orange swirls on the top. 

841
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Mary-Anne, going from being the only in the position of safety 

842
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,480
has jeopardised that because these weren't baked. 

843
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,360
No, they're not baked. They're quite raw inside. 

844
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,280
So Janet, who struggled over the weekend, and who's come up with something that needed to be better, 

845
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,800
and Mary-Anne, who started high and then just dropped. 

846
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,200
- OK. Well, we'll leave you to your deliberations.
- Go confer. 

847
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,880
Firstly, congratulations, all four of you. Normally, at this point, 

848
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,920
we'd announce a Star Baker, but the judges really feel that you all deserve 

849
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,360
a special commendation and that no-one should be singled out because you are all semi-finalists. 

850
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,040
So well done. 

851
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,640
OK. Now, you know we can't take all four of you with us into next week's final. 

852
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:54,640
So Paul and Mary have decided that the person not coming with us is... 

853
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,920
Janet. 

854
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,400
- That's fine. Can I just say, I've had a great time.
- Yay! 

855
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,920
Thanks to everyone for your generosity, your kindness and everything. 

856
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,160
You are brilliant. 

857
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,040
I suppose, you know, everybody would want, if they entered the competition, 

858
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:28,920
to get through to the final, but, you know, I've gone so much further than I ever dreamt I would. 

859
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,840
I mean, my luck did run out today, quite obviously, 

860
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,480
because my pastries were not up to the standard they expected. 

861
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,280
You know, it has to be on merit, and clearly I didn't merit being in the final three, so... 

862
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,560
and that's fair enough. 

863
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,400
'I'm so chuffed to be in the final.' 

864
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,880
I feel very emotional, but in a really nice way. Yeah. 

865
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
I, I'm a little bit... 

866
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,080
never lost for words, of course, being me, but I am a little bit. 

867
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,280
It hasn't quite sunk in yet, that I managed to survive despite my baking efforts today, 

868
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,000
but I'm not going to dwell on it because clean slate next week and everything to play for. 

869
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,320
Oh, I really am 

870
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,240
totally gobsmacked. 

871
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,760
Sorry! 

872
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,800
I can't, I really can't, honestly, truly believe it. 

873
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,320
- Next time...
- Why is my hand shaking? 

874
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,760
- It's the final.
- I've been feeling nauseous since yesterday. 

875
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,520
I still think anyone could win it. 

876
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,440
Holly, Jo and Mary-Anne must bake for a street party. 

877
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,560
- You seem very quiet. Is that focus? 
- That's blind panic. 

878
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,240
I think nerves are a really, really big issue. 

879
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,840
Only perfection will do. 

880
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,480
It's a huge disappointment. 

881
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,080
Absolutely stunning. It's a perfect home bake. 

882
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,600
It's the toughest decision Mary and Paul have faced. 

883
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,600
They've really got to prove themselves. 

884
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,200
Never has pastry been so scrutinised. 

885
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,920
Who will be crowned the winner of the Great British Bake Off? 

886
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,280
The winner is...
