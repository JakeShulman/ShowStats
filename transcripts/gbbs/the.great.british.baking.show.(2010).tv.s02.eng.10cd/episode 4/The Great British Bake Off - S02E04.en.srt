00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Week four of our search to find Britain's best amateur baker. 

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,680
We've had tiered celebration cakes, magnificent platters of tarts and enough bread to feed 5,000. 

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,640
Or loosely translated, enough bread to feed Mel and myself. 

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,360
We started with 12 bakers and now there are eight. 

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
Welcome to the Great British Bake Off. 

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,400
Britain's home bakers have come together in this, 

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,120
the ultimate test of their baking skills. 

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,400
To win you need to be able to perform across the board. 

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,880
I haven't left the house. Locked in my kitchen. 

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,720
Last week was bread. 

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,120
It's a bit scary. You just want it to work. You want it to be right. 

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,560
And Paul's expectations were high. 

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,360
- Someone's not been following my recipe.
- The whole thing's collapsed. 

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Yasmin really impressed and was named star baker. 

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
Well done, Yasmin. 

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,480
But Urvashi and Ian didn't make the grade and were sent home. 

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
Outstanding! 

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,240
This week, the bakers take on biscuits. 

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,400
I don't know if I can bear to look at them. 

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
It looks very dishevelled. 

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
And these bite-size delights prove too much for some. 

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,360
This is the worst they've come out. 

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,280
Please, God, let me finish. 

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,560
Yes, things are getting serious, for this week the contestants 

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,640
will be getting themselves into a right royal flap...jack. 

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Today the bakers are facing biscuitgeddon. 

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,240
It's the fourth round of the Bake Off. This week, it's biscuits. 

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,320
Our bakers will need to prove they can deliver outstanding bakes 

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,480
in three increasingly more testing challenges. 

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,320
Tomorrow, for one person, 

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,840
their dream of becoming Britain's best amateur baker will be over. 

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Welcome, bakers, to this, the halfway mark of the Bake Off. 

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,880
So well done for getting this far, 

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,760
but there's no time to relax, because it's time for your first challenge, the signature bake. 

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,000
So what the judges would like you to do is to make 12 biscuits 

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,200
to your own very distinct flavour combination and, of course, 

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,800
you have to remember that the ideal biscuit, well, 

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,440
is something that Mel and I will trough, but also has a distinct bite. 

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
So it's not too soft, and it's not too crumbly. 

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,400
You have one and a half hours on the clock. 

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
- On your marks.
- Get set.
- Bake! 

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
Unlike cakes or bread, a biscuit is much more delicate. 

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Unforgiving in the oven, within seconds they can catch and burn, 

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,520
ruining both taste and texture. 

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,800
To achieve perfection requires precision. 

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,760
The humble biscuit can be quite deadly. 

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,480
Easy enough to bake, you think, but, actually, to bake them 

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,200
all the same colour with the same flavour is extremely difficult. 

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,240
The biscuits should be crisp, and if they're meant to be chewy, 

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,480
they should be chewy. They should all be uniform in shape. 

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,560
It should tempt me to eat it, and when you break it, 

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,240
it should have a perfect texture and be done right through. 

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,320
The essential biscuit ingredients are butter, sugar and flour. 

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,200
When I was practising, I made these biscuits about twice. 

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,320
The first time they were OK, a bit overcooked. 

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,920
But the second time they came out and tasted a lot nicer. 

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,400
Well, not a lot nicer, they were nice the first time. 

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,080
Jason taught himself how to bake from the age of just 12. 

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,840
His signature biscuit is called a lebkuchen, 

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,920
which is a traditional, soft-spiced German treat. 

61
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,040
They're not that hard. They're softer, which I'm worried about. 

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know what the judges will say. They've got spice in them. 

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm using mixed spice and cinnamon, 

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,640
and with chocolate on the top. It's a nice combination. 

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Rob grew up with baking. 

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,760
His mother taught him how to cook from the age of ten. 

67
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,640
My brother and dad would go to the football and I'd stay at home 

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,880
and help my mum make pastries. It was great. 

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,880
For one Christmas, and I've still got beef with this, 

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,040
my sister got a rolling pin, a little child's rolling pin, 

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,280
And it had "Hannah" on it. I never had one. So Hannah had a rolling pin. Mum had a rolling pin. 

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Well, where's mine? 

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,160
Today he's baking a family favourite, chocolate and ginger oat biscuits. 

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Chewy on the inside with a crunchy exterior. 

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
My granny always used to have them at her house. 

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,920
We always used to call them rejects. 

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,480
It's cos they don't come in a packet. They come in a see-through bag which reminds me of home, 

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,320
and just it being warm and comforting and nice. 

79
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,320
The biscuits I'm making today are grandmother's biscuits, 

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,440
so they're the sort of thing that I'd sit in front of the telly with, 

81
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,880
a cup of tea, and something I love to eat. 

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Hopefully the judges will enjoy them. 

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
Ben's hoping for success with his crunchy version of stem ginger nuts, 

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
which is a recipe he learnt from his grandmother. 

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,240
- Hello, Ben.
- Good morning. Good morning. Good morning! 

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
What's in these? 

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,800
It's basically flour, ginger powder. 

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,360
There's a piece of stem ginger and also some candied ginger in there as well. 

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,560
- So a lot of ginger flavour.
- What temperature do you bake these at? 

90
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,760
- These are going to be baked at 190. 
- Right.
- For about ten minutes. 

91
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,880
- Yeah.
- But there is a look and feel thing, so I don't want them 

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,560
to be too brown on the edges and burnt underneath. 

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Flour and eggs keep biscuits together. 

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,920
When the proteins in them are uncooked, they are small, 

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,920
tightly-coiled, separate strands. 

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,760
But heat causes them to unravel and fuse together to form a solid mass. 

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Concentrating on the appearance this week, 

98
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,680
so fingers crossed it all works out. 

99
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,120
Sausage-fingers does dainty! 

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,720
Mary-Anne's signature biscuits are called Melting Moments. 

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,520
The high butter content and use of cornflour gives them 

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,360
a crumbly, melt-in-the-mouth quality. 

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
I chose it because it's an anytime biscuit. 

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,680
You wouldn't have to go out and do a special shop 

105
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,360
if you wanted to make this, because you could literally 

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,680
open the cupboard and pull out what you need. 

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Once again Mary-Anne is showcasing her love of using 

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,200
inventive techniques to turn her biscuits into something special. 

109
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Before I put the dough in the piping bag 

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,440
I did a stripe of red food colouring down the side, 

111
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,080
so I think it's the same principle of toothpaste. 

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm going to put them in the freezer now for 15 minutes, 

113
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,320
and that will sort of freeze them, 

114
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,040
so that when they go in the oven the heat of the oven will hopefully cook the swirls a lot quicker 

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,080
and retain some of the nice shape. 

116
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,200
Like Mary-Anne, 

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,480
Holly is also making a delicate, melt-on-the-tongue biscuit. 

118
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,280
I just thought these were the sort of biscuit 

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,960
that you might serve at an afternoon tea for ladies. 

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Using home-made jam and custard cream as the filling, 

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,120
she's named hers Strawberry and Custard Melts. 

122
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,200
- Oh, you've piped them already. That was quick.
- Yeah. 
- How have you made the mix, then? 

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
It is creamed butter, very, very soft, 

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
with a bit of icing sugar. 

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,840
Instead of the cornflour, a little bit of custard powder and plain flour. 

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
- So it's kind of one-mouthful delights.
- Yeah. 

127
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,720
- Those are tiny, delicate. 
- They're very delicate. 

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
- They're very small, aren't they? 
- But when you've got two together, with the filling, 

129
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,520
I personally think that's enough. 

130
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
- And you're making a quick strawberry jam?
- Yeah.
- How are you doing that? 

131
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,200
You haven't got much time to do that. 

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,440
- Are you doing a very small amount? 
- Oh, she'll do it in no time. 
- It's four minutes.
- Minutes. 

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,040
It's a bit girlie, isn't it, the hearts? 

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,680
So I like the hearts. 

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Jo's signature bake is a recipe she developed herself, 

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,000
a lightly-fragranced and crumbly lavender biscuit. 

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everyone will like them, but it's a really different flavour, 

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,200
because lavender's not something that you come across every day, 

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,200
but I really like them. I think they're really summery and a lovely flavour. 

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,280
In last week's bread round, Yasmin dazzled the judges 

141
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,200
and was named star baker. 

142
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,640
Up until last week I felt that I'd gone relatively unnoticed. 

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,400
I was like, you know, flying under the radar a bit, 

144
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,160
and now there's pressure because they'll be looking at me more. 

145
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,640
Yasmin has chosen to bake a chocolate chip and pistachio biscotti, 

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
which are Italian dry twice-baked biscuits. 

147
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,480
A biscotti, you can add so many things to it, 

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,600
whether it be honey, walnut, pistachios, but it's all about the baking. 

149
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,880
- Yeah.
- You've got to get that crisp, 

150
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,600
because if you don't get that crisp it's not a biscotti. 

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
Bakers! One hour has gone. You've got half an hour to go. 

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,960
I've got two more to do, then I can shove them in the oven. 

153
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,680
The success of their biscuits rests heavily on that critical baking time. 

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
I hope they bake well. 

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,440
I hope they don't get overdone like they did at home. 

156
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,480
It's very easy to over-bake biscuits. 

157
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,480
You lose the consistency across the batch and they'll be overcooked. 

158
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,640
It's a waiting game and a praying game. 

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,040
And hoping that it's actually going to do what it needs to do 

160
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,680
and look fantastic, and everything goes to plan. 

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
So, fingers crossed. 

162
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,480
Now, delicious as those biscuits in the tent look, 

163
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,840
they won't do your waistline any favours. 

164
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,960
But back in the 18th century, 

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,200
eating biscuits on a diet was actually encouraged. 

166
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,120
In Georgian Bath, one particular biscuit 

167
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,960
became part of Britain's first ever calorie-controlled diet. 

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,240
Well, the whole of the 18th century is a century of appetite, 

169
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
so the mealtimes, in particular, are about excess, copious quantities 

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
of cream, cheeses, syllabubs, jellies, 

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
and, of course, lots of wine, port wine. 

172
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,080
All of this excess led, of course, to swelling waistbands, 

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,000
indigestion and gout. 

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,560
There was a nation of extremely unhealthy rich people. 

175
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,680
One medical practitioner believed that the solution lay not only 

176
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,320
in bathing in the waters, 

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,440
but in his invention of a new, low-calorie diet. 

178
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,280
Dr William Oliver decided that he would develop a biscuit. 

179
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,920
And this biscuit has now become known as the Bath Oliver biscuit. 

180
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,840
It's a very unusual biscuit with almost no sugar in it at all. 

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,360
It's low in calories, and with this biscuit, Dr Oliver thought 

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,720
he could control the waistlines of the wealthy 

183
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,200
and he could aid digestion because the biscuits had yeast in them. 

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,240
For 15 years, Dr Oliver prescribed a diet of Bath Oliver biscuits, 

185
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,440
eaten whilst sat in the spa water. 

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
By reducing his patients' excessive consumption, 

187
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,360
he dramatically improved their health. 

188
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,920
Shortly before he died, Dr Oliver bestowed his secret biscuit recipe 

189
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,560
to his long-serving coachman, Atkins. 

190
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,760
He then decided to mass market the product, 

191
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,680
and set up his own biscuit baking business. 

192
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
Over 250 years later, the simple savoury biscuit has become 

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
a popular addition to a cheese board. 

194
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,160
And in complete antithesis to Dr Oliver's original enterprise, 

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,800
is now available completely covered in rich dark chocolate. 

196
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
20 minutes to go. 

197
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,320
The biscuits are still in the oven, 

198
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,400
but time is running out. 

199
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,560
The trouble is that when you do them at home, you don't look in the oven all the time, 

200
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,560
you just trust they're doing. Here, you become neurotic, and I'm trying to resist the temptation 

201
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
because it's irrevocable anyway, now. 

202
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,520
Ben's keen to do his grandma's ginger nut recipe proud. 

203
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,200
With the sugar and everything that's in them, they can occasionally catch. 

204
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
So I've done a few at home, and some of them 

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,360
were a little darker underneath than I'd have liked. 

206
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,720
So what I want to try and do is just make sure that I get a nice, even bake. 

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
A nice colour on the top. 

208
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,960
And there's lots of things I'm looking at. 

209
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
So I'm watching them like a hawk. 

210
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm reasonably pleased with how they're looking. 

211
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,960
I'd like more of a crack on top. 

212
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,560
But it is actually, you know, it is getting it, it's fine. 

213
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm one of those people who like to prod and poke and see if everything's OK. 

214
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,200
And actually, I've got to resist and just not touch them 

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,640
cos they disintegrate really easily. 

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,120
This was given me by a very dear aunt who died in '96, 

217
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
and she gave it me when my children were small, for Christmas. 

218
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,360
You know, to put stuff on. 

219
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,320
So I always use this plate for these biscuits at Christmas. 

220
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,520
Janet's making her own invention, Christmas biscuits. 

221
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,360
A festive favourite using marzipan, 

222
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,880
which has a tendency to ooze out when baked. 

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
It's because the marzipan expands inside 

224
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,720
and there's no room for it, except coming through the top. 

225
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,960
No-one can control volcanoes. 

226
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,200
You've got ten minutes to go. 

227
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,440
Ten minutes to go, gang. 

228
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't know whether to put chocolate on or not, 

229
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,040
cos I don't know whether they necessarily need it. 

230
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,400
I don't know whether it's just a bit of a bad idea. 

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm trying to cool my chocolate down 

232
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,000
but I don't want to put it in the fridge cos sometimes it can go a little bit white in the fridge. 

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
So I just want to try and set it. 

234
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,120
- Morning, Jason.
- Hello, Jason. 
- Good morning, all. 

235
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,320
I've just got the decoration left to do. 

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,560
So I'm going to... I still haven't decided what I'm doing. 

237
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,040
This is your signature biscuit. 

238
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,520
This is something you make often and so you should know how to finish it. 

239
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,880
I did at home. I'm still throwing ideas round. There'll be chocolate and mixed peel on top. 

240
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,520
- He's always working... 
- So wait and see.
- Yeah, Paul. 

241
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,760
- So you're finished now, essentially. You're just finishing them off? 
- Yeah.
- OK. 

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,040
It's not just a normal buttercream, is it? 

243
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,000
No. This is a variation I found called Depression Era buttercream, 

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,520
which is, rather than using just sugar and butter, 

245
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
it's sort of padded out, almost, 

246
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,000
with a flour and milk mixture that's cooked until it's thickened. 

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,640
Is this the Great Depression in America in '30s? 

248
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,080
I think so, yes. I found several people commenting online that their mothers made it 

249
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
or their grandmothers made it. 

250
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,600
So you've essentially made a contemporary austerity biscuit. 

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,920
- Yes.
- For the credit crunch times. 

252
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm going to drench these in chocolate. 

253
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
I've thinned it down with a bit of vegetable oil. 

254
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,400
Just put a nice thin layer over all of it. 

255
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,240
But I don't want too much chocolate, or it'll be overkill, 

256
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
cos the biscuits are thin. 

257
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,120
White, unlike milk and dark chocolate, contains no cocoa solids, 

258
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,920
but instead, the fatty content of the bean - cocoa butter. 

259
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,360
This, mixed with vegetable oil, creates a loose consistency. 

260
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,640
The white chocolate probably won't set in time. I'm going to flash it in the freezer for what time I have. 

261
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
That's one minute to go, bakers. 

262
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,280
They've just got to cool now. 

263
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,240
Just a little bit of purpley colour to show the lavender, and a little bit of gold. 

264
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
Just for my finishing little bit of sparkle. 

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,560
There we go. All done. 

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,680
Time is up, ladies and gents of the baking world. Your time is up. 

267
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
The bakers must now face judgment for their signature biscuit. 

268
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,880
A festival of daintiness. 

269
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,000
They look like little gems. They look really pretty and sweet. 

270
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,360
They've lost some of their shape in the oven. 

271
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,320
If you wanted a little bit more definition you could have fridged them before you baked them. 

272
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,400
- And you had plenty of time.
- Mmm, that is melty.
- It's got a good melt. 

273
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,280
- Well melty.
- It's got a good colour. The flavours are great. 

274
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,960
- The taste is actually great. You are getting the ginger. 
- The middle is scrummy. 

275
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,160
- The only thing is, they're slightly over-baked.
- Yeah. 

276
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,800
And if you move along here, this one's very over-baked. 

277
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,680
That's why it wasn't at the front! 

278
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,760
- So you basically tried to hide that one?
- Yeah, that was just being covered up a bit. 

279
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,040
This is Miss Marple here you're dealing with. 

280
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,320
We are looking for originality, 

281
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,400
and this is a family recipe that you really enjoy. 

282
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,880
You've done a lot. You're totally confident with. 

283
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,320
You have a beautiful flavour. I love the marzipan. 

284
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,960
I'd like to have seen a bit more colour lifted up on the top. 

285
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,720
The appearance of the top is lovely. That nice crackle on the top. 

286
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,840
- You've caught a few of them there. 
- Ah, yeah.
- Yeah. 

287
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,400
Yes, you have. For my taste, I think it's slightly over-gingered. 

288
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,760
But I like ginger and I always have, so my ginger nuts are always a bit 

289
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,040
hotter and my grandmother's ginger nuts were always a bit hotter, 

290
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,640
- which is why I've put quite a bit of ginger in. 
- I like the flavour of ginger, 

291
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
- but the burn that comes is, for me, too much.
- OK. 

292
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,560
These I think are a very good example of something that's really 

293
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,560
difficult to make, but I would have liked a lot more nuts in it. 

294
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,200
The thing about a biscotti is it's dense with flavour. 

295
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,680
- Yeah.
- And you've got large areas of big, empty crust. 

296
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,000
The texture's excellent. 

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,400
It's very, very good, but for me, a biscotti should be absolutely 

298
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
- rammed full of whatever you're putting in there.
- Yeah. 

299
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,920
What's making it bitter? 

300
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,680
It's lavender. But it's not a lavender you recognise. 

301
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,960
- It's a very difficult thing to use, lavender.
- Yeah. I just thought 

302
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,880
I like them and I just thought it was something different. 

303
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,320
It's just not working, that lavender, is it? 

304
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,920
No. I've nearly finished one and I'm not getting it coming through at all. 

305
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,320
Is this the way you wanted them to look? 

306
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,680
Once I decided how I wanted them to look, this is it, and I'm very pleased with how they look. 

307
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,640
You're very pleased. For me, it doesn't look like a biscuit. It looks more like a pudding. 

308
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,200
The chocolate didn't need anything with it, if it was a thin coating. 

309
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,080
The flavour of that cinnamon with the mixed spice is very strong. 

310
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,880
Jason, this doesn't work, really. 

311
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,040
- The look of them, they look great. 
- Thank you. 

312
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,000
I'd never have thought of putting colouring in, just a swirl. 

313
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,920
- So pretty.
- Mmm, it's beautiful. 

314
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,640
- And the filling is good.
- Thank you. 

315
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,080
I think the flavour of the biscuit is baked extremely well. 

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
Thank you. 

317
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,920
It does melt. The flavour in that is really nice as well. 

318
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,360
It looks very professional. 

319
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,480
- So good.
- Well done. 
- Thank you very much. 

320
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,320
- I'm just going to keep this for research purposes.
- OK, OK. 

321
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,720
The judges felt Mary-Anne excelled with her signature bake. 

322
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,240
But Jason, Ben, Yasmin and Jo failed to impress. 

323
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm really, really happy with the biscuit 

324
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,600
and the comments they made, and it turned out just the way I wanted. 

325
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
If my gran was here, she'd probably be chasing Paul down the road, 

326
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
cos those were an old family recipe. 

327
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,160
We love ginger. 

328
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,000
I didn't think they were too hot. 

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
So, watch out, Paul, cos Gran will probably be after you. 

330
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,560
After the originality of the signature bake, the second challenge is a technical one. 

331
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,840
The recipe the bakers are about to be given is a complete surprise. 

332
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,200
Onwards, bakers. 

333
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
It's the technical challenge. 

334
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
Now, Paul and Mary have chosen a special challenge for you today, 

335
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,680
and as we all know, they will judge it blind. 

336
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,400
Paul and Mary, if you would please vacate the tent, thank you very much. 

337
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,920
What we'd like you to do is to make 24... 

338
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,240
..brandy snaps. 

339
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,480
OK. We need them to be of equal colour. 

340
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,000
We need them to be of equal size 

341
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,240
and we'd like them filled with whipped cream. 

342
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,440
We are giving you just one and a half hours on the clock. 

343
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,760
On your marks. Get set. 

344
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,320
Bake them snaps. 

345
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
Brandy snaps are tubular and lacy brittle biscuits flavoured 

346
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,720
with ginger and usually served filled with whipped cream. 

347
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,080
Unlike the name suggests, not all recipes include brandy 

348
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,680
as an ingredient, including this one. 

349
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,480
Bakers are all given the same ingredients and a basic recipe. 

350
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,880
If they are to produce successful brandy snaps, 

351
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,200
they must use their baking knowledge to fill in the gaps. 

352
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,640
I chose brandy snaps because it's all about timing and precision. 

353
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,360
It's really accurate weighing, to start with. 

354
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,160
That's the most important thing. 

355
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,760
And it'll be very easy to see who has got it just right. 

356
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,840
The recipe requires butter, sugar, syrup, 

357
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,760
sifted flour with ground ginger, and finally, lemon juice. 

358
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,600
One of the things that they've got to concentrate on is dissolving the sugar, 

359
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,320
and you have to have patience to do it over a low heat, 

360
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,920
and you just do it with a wooden spoon 

361
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,480
so that you can feel no grit at the bottom of the pan. 

362
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,840
There's a danger that the mixture can burn or caramelise. 

363
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,800
Then they must take it off the heat and cool it for a moment, 

364
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,480
cos otherwise, if you add the flour it could go in lumpy. 

365
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
Then the little bit of lemon juice. 

366
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,400
I've never made these before, I'm well scared. 

367
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,160
I was talking to my mum this week and we were talking about what the technical challenge could be, 

368
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,800
and the first thing that she thought it could be is brandy snaps, 

369
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,040
and she said, "Just in case, just make sure you watch a video 

370
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,200
"or something of how to make them." And I didn't get round to it. 

371
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,840
So I'm a bit gutted. 

372
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,080
I went through Mary's baking bible and chose all the things that I had never made that looked difficult. 

373
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,400
And brandy snaps were the only one I managed to actually end up doing. 

374
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,520
I guessed right, so that's good. 

375
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,640
Ben's signature bake was not as well received as he'd hoped. 

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm really disappointed, actually. 

377
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,160
Not going to over-think it. 

378
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm just going to crack on with this and hopefully redeem myself somewhat. 

379
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,280
So how do you pick yourself up when you get news like that? 

380
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,840
With me I just get on with it. 

381
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
Whether I do well or not, I just get on with it. 

382
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
You are Teflon, Jason. 

383
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,200
- Never made a brandy snap before? 
- Never in my life. 

384
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,440
- Ever eaten a brandy snap before? 
- I don't think so.
- No. 

385
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,760
Teaspoons of the mixture need to be spaced at least 10cm apart 

386
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,400
to avoid spreading into one another. 

387
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,200
"Place four portions of mixture on the Bake-O-Glide." 

388
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
How much is a portion? 

389
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,080
Oh, it's getting too complicated 

390
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,800
and I've only got an hour and a half! 

391
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,640
20 minutes in, and the first of the three batches of snaps 

392
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
go into the oven. 

393
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,400
I'm a bit concerned about the timings, cos it's a lot - 

394
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,800
24, when you can only get 4 on each. 

395
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,720
It's a lot of trays to get in. I need to get more trays going. 

396
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,600
With just half an hour left to go in the technical challenge, 

397
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
the batches of the brandy snaps are at their most critical stage. 

398
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,000
I think maybe burning them could be quite possible 

399
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,520
cos of the high sugar content. 

400
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,480
It's like when you make caramel. 

401
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,640
They bake in the oven for around about eight minutes, or until 

402
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,000
the mixture is well spread and dark golden. 

403
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,200
Jo is experiencing problems as her batch lacks colour and is still soft. 

404
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,000
I thought if I just followed the recipe, they'd be all right. 

405
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,560
If brandy snaps are over-cooked or undercooked, 

406
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,000
they will not curl properly. 

407
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's just not gone right today. 

408
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,760
Rob's found his own method of shaping the brandy snaps. 

409
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,840
Rob, what went wrong here, love? 

410
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
No, no, no. It's not what's gone wrong, it's... 

411
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm cutting them out using a cutter. 

412
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Oh. These are quite weenie. 

413
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,920
Mmm, I figure if they were all exactly the same size. 

414
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,280
And brandy snaps, kind of, are so sweet, though. 

415
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,200
- Yeah.
- They're meant to be like a two-bite kind of thing.
- Yeah. 

416
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,160
- I just think they look quite nice. 
- Yeah. No, absolutely. 

417
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,400
The hardest decision to make is when to start curling. 

418
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
You've got this little window of about a minute between them 

419
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
being soft enough to roll and too brittle. 

420
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,640
No, don't sink, don't sink. 

421
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,720
Need asbestos fingers. 

422
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,800
It's just very painful. It's almost like torture. 

423
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,720
SHE SIGHS 

424
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
It's so frustrating. 

425
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,720
Jo is still baffled that her brandy snaps looks nothing like they should. 

426
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,200
The strict time limit of the technical challenge 

427
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,920
leaves no room for error. 

428
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,480
Oh, what it might have been is my oven was on the wrong temperature. 

429
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,440
My oven was on defrost. 

430
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,920
I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. 

431
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,000
But I didn't think to look at the oven because, you know, 

432
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,600
I thought it would be on the right temperature. 

433
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,560
I really hope that I don't go home over such a stupid mistake. 

434
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,040
The final stage is filling the brandy snaps. 

435
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,640
Bakers, keep those nozzles piping. 

436
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,360
You've got ten minutes to go. 

437
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,600
But the snaps must be cooled first, or the cream will melt. 

438
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,160
Please, please, please. Where's the breeze when you want it? 

439
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,160
Oh, gosh, it's hard to fill, isn't it? 

440
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Oh, no. Oh, oh, gosh. 

441
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Oh, no. 

442
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,840
Don't do this to me. 

443
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,120
Aye-aye, Captain! 

444
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
SHE LAUGHS 

445
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,440
One minute to go, bakers. 

446
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,400
Please, God, let me finish. 

447
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,560
Nightmare. 

448
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,840
OK, that's time up, everyone. Time is up. 

449
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,600
If you'd like to bring your brandy snaps up and put it just behind the picture of yourself. 

450
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,440
The judging of the technical bake is unlike any other challenge. 

451
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,560
As Mary and Paul have seen nothing of the baking process, 

452
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
they won't know whose is whose. 

453
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,440
They come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? 

454
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,560
I want to see which one's got the best snap. 

455
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,760
Shall we start here, then, Mary? 

456
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,120
- They're nice and lacy. 
- It's very thick, though. 

457
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,920
I think they're too big - it's been slightly overdone. 

458
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,960
The colour's very dark. 

459
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,360
- These ones are a lot lighter. 
- They're all different sizes. 

460
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,560
Someone's been hiding things at the bottom. 

461
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,120
They don't snap. 

462
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
A brandy snap should snap. 

463
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
These are sort of cocktail-sized. 

464
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
Why are they so small? 

465
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,200
It's crisp, but it doesn't have that snap quality, 

466
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,360
- which is what you want.
- It's too small for the amount of mixture. 

467
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,240
Very inconsistent. There's no consistency in colour. The flavour's OK. 

468
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,560
The flavour's OK and it's lovely and crisp. 

469
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,200
This is a mess. 

470
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,120
Something's gone wrong here. 

471
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,360
They're too pale. 

472
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,600
They're like rubber. 

473
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,120
These look rather nice. 

474
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,280
These look great, actually. 

475
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,280
We have to go to the bottom to see what's there. 

476
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,440
They're all consistent in their shape, aren't they? 

477
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,920
And it's got a good crunch. 

478
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,560
These are consistent in size. 

479
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,160
They're thin. They're crispy. 

480
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
Nice colour. 

481
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,640
Just a little bit under-whipped cream. 

482
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,720
They're all pretty much the same length. 

483
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
- Now we have to decide.
- We do. 

484
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,280
Mary and Paul must rank all the brandy snaps 

485
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
from the worst to the best. 

486
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,440
OK. We've made our decisions, 

487
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,600
and the person in last place is this one. 

488
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,920
- Jo, basically it was under-cooked. 
- Yeah.
- Mix went a bit wrong. 

489
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
You need to leave it in the oven longer. 

490
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,680
Well, I turned my oven on to defrost by accident. 

491
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,240
Ah, that doesn't help! 

492
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,720
And the next one in line at number seven is this one here. 

493
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,920
These are very tiny little people. 

494
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,240
I cut them out so that they were all exactly the same size. 

495
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,120
Well, that is an unnecessary occupation, really. 

496
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
And in sixth place is this one. 

497
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,240
- Me.
- Very inconsistent. Some of them are soft. Some of them are crispy. 

498
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,800
- Some haven't been in the oven long enough.
- And in fifth place... 

499
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,440
These are over-baked. They look lovely and lacy, 

500
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,680
but they were a bit hard. 

501
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,320
- And the next place is this one. Number four.
- It's me. 

502
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,880
Janet, these aren't bad. They're a bit inconsistent with colour. 

503
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,000
You're right. 

504
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,160
And in third place... 

505
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,320
These are a beautiful, even shape. 

506
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,800
It was very tricky, actually, between first and second, 

507
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,840
but it was purely based on consistency of colour. Number two is this one. 

508
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Mary-Anne, not bad. The cream wasn't whisked enough to sit inside. 

509
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,160
That leaves us with just one. 

510
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,880
And this is in first place. HE LAUGHS 

511
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,720
Baked to perfection. Beautifully lacy. What more could we ask? 

512
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Well done, everyone. 

513
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,760
I was very shocked. I was really excited. Made my day. Especially from this morning, 

514
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,480
I don't know what happened there, but it's given me a boost of confidence. 

515
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,880
I do feel really gutted that I, you know, mucked up so ridiculously. 

516
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,760
I just feel like it's such a stupid thing to do. 

517
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,520
But I've just got to accept it, really, and, you know, move on. 

518
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,040
It's the final challenge of the biscuit week. 

519
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,040
This is their last opportunity to impress Mary and Paul. 

520
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,080
One baker will soon be hanging up their apron. 

521
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,800
So, Mary, Paul, who is in trouble? 

522
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Well, I think Ben's in trouble. 

523
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
He made ginger biscuits. 

524
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,080
They were so strong of ginger, they were just overpowering. 

525
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,960
It was like a spice grenade, wasn't it? 

526
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,920
And also his brandy snaps. They were dark, over-baked. 

527
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,720
So he hasn't covered himself in glory. 

528
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,600
For me, Jo. Because Jo's biscuits were OK, but the lavender did not come through. 

529
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,520
Her brandy snaps were not good, either. 

530
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,120
Then you've got to bring in Yas. 

531
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,920
Yasmin's biscotti, for me, technically, too simple to make. 

532
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,360
It needed more pistachio. 

533
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,280
Bakers, this is your final bake. You're going to need to show your baking skills, 

534
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,000
but you're also going to have to unleash that creative side. 

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,080
Because it's the show-stopper challenge, and we're asking you 

536
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,200
to raise the bar and make a macaroon display, no less. 

537
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,880
The judges are going to be looking for three different flavours of macaroons, 

538
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,960
and also your flair at displaying them. 

539
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,640
You've got five hours to bake 120 macaroons, which will be sandwiched in 60 pairs. 

540
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,680
So there's no time to waste. Very best of luck. On your marks, get set... 

541
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,960
BOTH: Bake. 

542
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Macaroons are notoriously difficult to make. 

543
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,080
There are four stages. Mixing, resting, baking and filling. 

544
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,680
Five hours seems like a long time for this bake, 

545
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,640
but in reality it's never a long time, I don't think. 

546
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm looking for the best macaroons in this show-stopper. 

547
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,920
A smooth, glossy finish. A gooey centre. 

548
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,000
A nice crust on the outside. A great colour. 

549
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,160
And ultimately a fantastic flavour. 

550
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,760
Standard macaroon recipes use ground almonds 

551
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
together with egg whites and sugar. 

552
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,440
There are two different types of meringue used to make macaroons - French and Italian. 

553
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,920
The French method folds caster sugar into beaten egg whites, which must then rest before baking. 

554
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,840
The Italian way replaces caster sugar with a hot sugar syrup. 

555
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,720
It has to get to 118 degrees, so it's pretty important. 

556
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,680
It's to make sure the meringue's really stable. 

557
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,280
If it's not stable, the macaroons will drop. This is kind of the big... 

558
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,480
It's probably the most important bit apart from mixing. 

559
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,360
The heat of the molten sugar partly cooks the meringues, 

560
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,600
which means they require no resting time before baking. 

561
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,760
Personally, I'm not too keen on almonds and meringue, 

562
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
so it's not something that I've baked at all, 

563
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,960
until two weeks ago. Now, I've baked hundreds! 

564
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,640
Mary-Anne is making blackcurrant and mint, 

565
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,280
gooseberry and elderflower and hazelnut macaroons. 

566
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,240
She's following the Italian meringue method. 

567
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,120
I have tried both methods 

568
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,040
and I've found it difficult to judge with the French method 

569
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,240
when to stop stirring, because if you over-mix it, 

570
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,200
then it can't hold its shape and you end up just with a solid baking sheet of mixture. 

571
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,320
This is definitely the hardest one so far. 

572
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
After Jo's blunder with the oven temperature in the previous challenge, 

573
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,520
she now needs to keep her cool and focus. 

574
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,240
How are you? 

575
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,080
- Yes, I'm OK, thank you.
- No stress? 

576
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,040
- I don't know about that! 
- Don't peak now. You've got five hours to build that stress! 

577
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,040
- How are you going to present it? 
- I'm doing them on a French flag. 

578
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,640
- You're doing a tricolour. 
- On a French flag?!
- Yeah. 

579
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,640
- On the Great British Bake Off?
- Yes. 
- Come on, we're friends! 

580
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,760
You need to forget that. It was a long time ago. Waterloo is well and truly forgotten. 

581
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,160
For both types of meringue, bakers need to be careful not to over-whisk the egg whites. 

582
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,320
If they do, the proteins in the eggs will separate from the water molecules, 

583
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,480
leaving them with a dry batter that's incapable of rising in the oven. 

584
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,720
And then they must carefully sieve the ground almonds 

585
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,520
before they add the colour and flavouring to ensure an even texture. 

586
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,880
The introduction of the flavour could make or break a macaroon. 

587
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,200
Too much, it'll break down the structural integrity of the macaroon, 

588
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,640
so it'll collapse. Too little, you get no flavour. 

589
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,960
Using essence or powdered flavouring is the best way to give the macaroon shells their taste. 

590
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,960
I practised about 300 macaroons on Thursday. 

591
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
You've got three different flavours to make. 

592
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,240
You've got to try and mix things as you're trying to bake other things 

593
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,680
and it's just a bit of a, kind of, nightmare. 

594
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,080
So we'll see how it goes. 

595
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,200
Ben has chosen the Italian meringue method to make his three flavours of macaroons. 

596
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Chocolate almond sandwiched with white chocolate, 

597
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
raspberry and pine nut 

598
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
and a pistachio macaroon filled with chocolate. 

599
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,200
The graphic designer is in his element doing this. 

600
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,400
They won't be that pink. They will soften when the meringue goes in. 

601
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm using pine nuts and almonds. Pine nuts have a lot of oil in them, 

602
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,400
so if you just pine nuts, the mixture goes very soft, 

603
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,920
and so you get odd-shaped macaroons. 

604
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,480
- I'm using almond as well to give it...
- To stabilise it. 
- ..body as well. 

605
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,640
- Do you think the pine nuts will come through?
- They should do. 

606
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,120
Macaroons generally are these dainty things in often quite unusual flavours. 

607
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,960
They're quite grown-up, and I thought, wouldn't it be lovely 

608
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,120
if I could introduce my son to the memories of my childhood chocolate bars? 

609
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,840
Holly is using cocoa powder to flavour all three macaroons. 

610
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,840
The fillings she's using are caramel, mint chocolate and chocolate orange. 

611
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,040
I made them for the first time this year. My son tried one. 

612
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,600
Absolutely loved them. He calls them "maca-oons". 

613
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,120
Once the macaroon batter is made, bakers need to pipe the mixture. Making them uniform in size is key. 

614
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah, I can pipe them. 

615
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,720
It's the baking where it all kicks off. 

616
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,920
It's really important that you create a volume to start with 

617
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,720
and then you knock it out. 

618
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,480
Hello, Holly, I saw you doing a very professional bang of the tray. 

619
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
You're got to be firm with it, haven't you? 

620
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,760
- You were disciplining those macaroons!
- I was disciplining the macaroons, yeah. 

621
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,840
To create a smooth, shiny top, the batter should be left to rest for an hour, 

622
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,720
or until a skin has formed over the macaroon. 

623
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,880
Everything's so precise about this baking and I'm just not. 

624
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,520
I'm more of a bit of this and a bit of that, and everything has to be spot on. 

625
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,080
I just decided I'll do one batch at a time, 

626
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
otherwise I'll just confuse myself. 

627
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,560
Yasmin's making French meringue to create her three macaroons - 

628
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,640
lime sandwiched with chocolate ganache, coffee with walnuts 

629
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,320
and coconut with pineapple. 

630
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,800
It is really easy to lose track of what you're doing. I find it a daunting task, anyway. 

631
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,080
What did I just put in there? 

632
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
120, 120. 

633
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,200
- Yasmin has classic flavour combinations.
- The flavours that she's got on there are great. 

634
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,920
She hasn't rested them for long. She hasn't knocked the air out. 

635
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,120
So you're going to get blown macaroons. 

636
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,800
Look at that perfect amount of mix. Hey, hey. 

637
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,240
Jason is being inventive with his mocktail-inspired recipe. 

638
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,880
He's chosen French meringue for his mojito, 

639
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,400
cranberry cooler 

640
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
and pina colada macaroons. 

641
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,800
I suppose it is odd, because I don't drink, but it's more the flavours that I'm going for. 

642
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,120
It's not going to be identical, because these are solid and the drinks are liquid. 

643
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,280
I really like playing around with flavours. 

644
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,920
And chocolate will go with a lot of strong, strong flavours. 

645
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,000
Ginger doesn't go with loads of things. It goes with chocolate. 

646
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,040
Huge flavours can be mixed with chocolate. It's incredible. 

647
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,760
Using French meringue, Rob's typically being adventurous with his flavours. 

648
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,960
He's making strawberry and lime, 

649
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,320
lemon and chocolate macaroons with a cardamom-flavoured filling. 

650
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,320
- Be careful with the cardamom. Don't go mad.
- It's very strong. 

651
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,400
You don't want to have that almost numbing feeling in your mouth afterwards. 

652
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,320
You should be left with a sweet tang. 

653
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,720
Macaroon makers, this is your half time shout-out. 

654
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,200
You've got two and a half hours to go. 

655
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,720
With 120 perfect macaroons to produce... 

656
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Nightmare. 

657
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,120
..time is against our bakers. 

658
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,440
Only the first batches are ready to bake. 

659
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,440
It's really hard to use an oven that isn't yours for something that's so temperamental. 

660
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,120
Cooking time can be anywhere from 12 to 18 minutes. 

661
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,800
It's always very nervous waiting for the first batch to come out and see what they look like. 

662
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm hoping that these are going to just rise nicely, 

663
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,760
because I have done them before and they've cracked. So we'll just have to see. 

664
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,800
In as little as 60 seconds, a macaroon can go from flawless to failure. 

665
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,600
Whilst a plate of freshly-baked biscuits is definitely a cause for celebration, 

666
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,840
there was a time when the arrival of a biscuit was the sign of a much more fearful occasion. 

667
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,680
In Victorian times, funerals were incredibly grand affairs and could cost 

668
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,840
as much as Â£50,000 in today's money. 

669
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,040
By the mid-1800s, it was estimated that a quarter of the money in British banks 

670
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,800
had been put aside to pay for them. 

671
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,520
One essential expense was that of the funeral biscuit. 

672
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,840
Today, we don't associate biscuits with funerals. 

673
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,120
But, in the Victorian period, they were an essential element. 

674
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,520
Funeral biscuits came in three main varieties. 

675
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,800
Some were what we'd now recognise as ladies' fingers, or boudoir biscuits. 

676
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,040
There are others which are like a slab of thin sponge cake. 

677
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,200
And then the other kind, particularly from the Yorkshire Dales, 

678
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,240
was a shortcake which was flavoured with caraway. 

679
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,880
The first use of the biscuit was as an invitation. 

680
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
Instead of just expecting people to turn up, they had to be bidden. 

681
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,280
And you had a bidder. You went round with a basket with a cloth over the top with the biscuits in 

682
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,720
and they'd knock on the house door, pass you your biscuit 

683
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,040
and say you are bidden to the funeral of whoever it was, 

684
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,000
lifting at so and so and burying at so and so. 

685
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,280
To protect the fragile biscuits, 

686
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,880
they were wrapped individually in white paper and sealed with a black wax. 

687
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,520
They were often printed with traditional imagery and religious verse. 

688
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,960
Making funeral biscuits actually took quite a lot of effort. 

689
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
If you think about working 

690
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,960
in conditions where you had to sieve the flour, 

691
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,600
to actually break the sugar off a sugar cone and pound it up, 

692
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,120
if you had to make 100 funeral biscuits, it was quite a tall order. 

693
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,960
The caraway seeds would have been used for flavouring, 

694
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,360
and it's possible that, originally, the seeds symbolised some kind of rebirth. 

695
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,760
In comparison to modern shortbread, the recipe produced a very rich biscuit, 

696
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,440
as it required ten ounces of butter to every 12 ounces of flour. 

697
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,320
Once combined into a dough, equal parts were then separated and stamped 

698
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,880
using a traditional mould. 

699
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,640
This is actually a funeral biscuit mould. 

700
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,480
Moulds were always wooden. It was what they had available. 

701
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,680
And it's stamping the pattern on the top that really makes it a funeral biscuit. 

702
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,800
The production of funeral biscuits continued across Britain into the 20th century until 1940, 

703
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,160
when rationing tightened the belt of this Victorian tradition. 

704
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,320
It's a nail-biting moment for the bakers as the first batches of macaroons are coming out. 

705
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,840
I'm not happy with these ones. 

706
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,000
Same mix I use at home, completely different results in this oven. 

707
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,920
So they're just going to have to go on taste. 

708
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,360
Oh, my God! 

709
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,760
That says it all, doesn't it? Floor littered with remains. 

710
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,320
Oh, that's a relief! 

711
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,560
Jo is hoping her blueberry, coconut and strawberry macaroons will keep her in the competition. 

712
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,480
- How are you feeling?
- Yeah, no, I feel OK. Yeah, I feel fine. 

713
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,920
How many macaroons do you reckon you've made in the last week? 

714
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,040
In the last week, I reckon I've made, no exaggeration, 500. 

715
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,040
- There's a lot of macaroons floating around Essex!
- There is, yeah! 

716
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, those look really perfect. 

717
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah, they look pretty. 

718
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,360
I don't know if I can bear to look at them. 

719
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,600
- I have one macaroon, or six long macaroons. 
- SHE LAUGHS 

720
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,520
The French have a lot to answer for. 

721
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,680
I'll put the next ones in for sacrifice now. 

722
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,520
I just want them to be OK. I don't need them to be the best, 

723
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,800
but I don't want to look like an idiot, you know. 

724
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,360
A traditionalist, Janet is using French meringue 

725
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,080
to make her raspberry, blackcurrant and almond macaroons. 

726
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,520
Like her mother, she prefers baking wholesome, family food. 

727
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,680
She used to make coloured meringues when we were little, 

728
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,400
but, you know, like on Sundays she used to make a tray 

729
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,160
twice as big as that of apple pie looking like the Himalayas, you know. 

730
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,080
It wasn't sort of delicate baking she did at all. 

731
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,120
Ben's still having difficulties with his macaroon shells. 

732
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,560
There's nothing you can do when these things happen. Never give up. 

733
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,640
Carry on going. See what happens. You never know what's going to happen. 

734
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,000
- Last tray.
- OK, that's 30 minutes remaining, bakers! 30 minutes. 

735
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,280
Start filling. 

736
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,840
Macaroons can be sandwiched with jam, ganache or buttercream. 

737
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,720
The finished product should be able to stand on its side 

738
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,360
and not lose its filling. 

739
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,360
I quite like it. It's almost therapeutic. 

740
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,400
You're just running through doing the same things, really. 

741
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,440
Yasmin's macaroons are all collapsing. 

742
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,720
- Anything I can do, Yasmin? 
- No. Thank you, though. 

743
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,560
What is it that's been so awful about it? 

744
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,800
Just not knowing. From start to finish, 

745
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,760
I really have no idea what they're supposed to be like, 

746
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,720
what the mixture's supposed to be like. 

747
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,040
Even the finished product, what it's supposed to be like. 

748
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,120
I didn't realise I'd get as emotional with baking, 

749
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,280
but I think it's such a big thing in my household, 

750
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,960
and throughout my life, I was brought up with baking. 

751
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,240
My mother taught me to bake and she would have just been so incredibly proud of me... 

752
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,000
..that I've gotten this far. 

753
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,320
You've come a long way to be here. You've beaten all those other hundreds of people. 

754
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,240
You've made it to the last eight. 

755
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,760
I don't want to blow it at the last minute by doing something stupid. 

756
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,840
That's what it is. 

757
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,360
If I go out because other people are so much better 

758
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,720
and I did everything I could, 

759
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,960
but I've done something majorly wrong, and, you know, I've got myself to blame, really. 

760
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,520
Don't be so hard on yourself. Serve 'em up. They're going to taste absolutely gorgeous. 

761
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,640
- Hopefully, they'll come through on taste.
- You'll be fine. You'll be absolutely fine, my love. 

762
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,560
Yasmin is not the only baker who's finding macaroons a challenge. 

763
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,080
The mixture was looser because I added more liquid, 

764
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,880
because I thought I could get more flavour into the actual shells 

765
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,440
by adding elderflower cordial, and I did it before and it didn't work, 

766
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,600
so I'm not really sure why I did it this time thinking it would work. Maybe magic. 

767
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,600
OK, that's five minutes remaining. 

768
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,640
This, for me, is the best bit. 

769
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,120
You can bake something that's OK and present it in a way that people just don't expect 

770
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,800
and they go, "That's fantastic." 

771
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,520
Don't do that. 

772
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,640
With only minutes to spare, 

773
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,840
Mary-Anne still needs to pipe a whole batch of hazelnut macaroons. 

774
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,400
Please tell me somebody else is working 

775
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,200
and not all eyes are on me flapping around. 

776
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,040
I've gone past panic into that calm where, you know, 

777
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,120
the train is coming and I'm just going to let it hit me. 

778
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,760
That's one minute to go, bakers! 

779
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,800
Time up, everyone. Time up. 

780
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,200
There are no second chances. 

781
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,600
For one of these bakers it will be the last time they face the judges. 

782
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,840
- Overall we've had a few disasters, haven't we?
- Yeah. 

783
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,920
- It's disintegrated when you've put it in the oven.
- Yeah. 

784
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,720
The crunch is good. It's got a good flavour as well. 

785
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,160
You've got a little bit of a shine on that, but on the other two there is no shine at all. 

786
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,640
This one is over-baked a bit. 

787
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,520
Just too crisp. 

788
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,680
Let's try the... This is the pina colada? 

789
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,920
Yeah. 

790
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,120
It's nice and chewy in the middle. 

791
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,840
You've got the flavour coming through. It makes you smile. 

792
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,200
It tastes so good. You can taste the orange. 

793
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Orange is lovely. And they look so pretty. 

794
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,560
Janet, look at that. 

795
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,960
- You see this big hole in there? 
- Yes, I do. 

796
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,360
And that means that it's very, very dry. This one looks better. 

797
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,240
- See the inside of that?
- Excellent. 

798
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,160
And you see how gooey it is? And that one tastes nice as well. 

799
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,520
- Oh, good, I'm glad. 
- That's a better macaroon. 

800
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,760
Let's try again. 

801
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,560
Too wet, and it's gone straight into the macaroon 

802
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,200
and made it so soft and squidgy, 

803
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,160
but having said that, they're absolutely delicious. 

804
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,240
Nice and chewy. 

805
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,040
Crisp on top. This one's got a lovely consistency in the middle. 

806
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,640
This is just how a macaroon should be. 

807
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,400
Crisp on the outside, 

808
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,760
soft in the middle, 

809
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,320
and they do taste of strawberries. That's what they're meant to be of. 

810
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,720
- The presentation is unusual. 
- It looks very dishevelled. 

811
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,200
They're all different sizes. 

812
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,960
They're horrendous. 

813
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,160
The filling's fine. It's delicious. 

814
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,600
Again, the mixture's too dry. That's what's caused that. 

815
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,040
- A great big hole. Really dry. 
- The flavour's nice. 

816
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,480
This is the worst they've come out. 

817
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,240
I did 300 on Thursday, and not a problem. Not a problem. 

818
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,640
- And today...
- It's a disaster. 
- ..it's all crashed.
- It is a disaster. 

819
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,160
Visually they're great. 

820
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
And you have got a shine 

821
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,520
on pretty much all of them. 

822
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,680
Delicious. Scrummy, aren't they? 

823
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,800
The flavours are great. They look great. 

824
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,640
This is a very good batch. 

825
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:09,320
They are a little bit thin, but actually I think they're a very nice size. 

826
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,320
This looks very neat and shiny on top. It's so difficult to get that shine quite right. 

827
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,640
- Oh.
- Have you got it? 

828
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,760
Too much cardamom. Far too much cardamom. 

829
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,680
The first taste you have is lots of chocolate, sweetness, heavenly joy. 

830
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,520
The last bit is leaving a dentist. 

831
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,280
Comments weren't as good as I expected. 

832
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,920
Chocolate and cardamom, I'll still stand by that. 

833
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,400
I had one afterwards, I don't think there was too much cardamom at all. 

834
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,000
There's winning to please the judges 

835
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,440
and there's winning to please yourself. 

836
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,800
So I can hold my head up high and say I did everything I wanted to do. 

837
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,880
I'm so scared. I think I have a 50/50 chance of staying in the competition. 

838
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,720
The judges must now assess the bakers' overall performance across the weekend. 

839
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,760
They will then decide who to send home, 

840
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,800
but first they need to choose who will become this week's star baker. 

841
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,880
For me I was really surprised that I have to say Jason, 

842
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,200
- although on the first day for me he was bottom of the biscuits. 
- His lebkuchen. Yeah. 

843
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,880
Since then he's got top, top. 

844
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,320
Mary-Anne was doing brilliantly. 

845
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,360
- A great day yesterday. 
- Didn't she just? 

846
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,320
But today has not been so good. 

847
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,960
- Anybody else in contention? 
- Yes. I mean Holly. 

848
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,680
I think she was up there with her brandy snap, 

849
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,360
and her biscuits were up there as well. 

850
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,880
If we look at those who are 

851
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,520
in real genuine danger of being sent home this week, 

852
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,440
who's in the relegation spot? 

853
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,160
- Ben.
- Today his macaroons were a disaster. Admitted by himself. 

854
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,240
They were different sizes. Some of the flavours didn't work. 

855
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,160
And I was really rather disappointed, 

856
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,480
- because I thought he's a good baker. 
- Yes. 

857
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,360
Can I also throw in Yasmin as well? 

858
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,160
Her biscotti needed attention. 

859
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,080
She was certainly in the bottom half for the brandy snap, 

860
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,640
and then when you looked at the macaroons today, 

861
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,040
there were a couple of major disasters on there. It was a mess. 

862
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,080
Bakers, what a good few days it's been. 

863
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,560
We've seen frayed bottoms, 

864
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,880
cracked tops and overstuffed middles, and now it's the moment of truth. 

865
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,000
Mary and Paul have decided that this week 

866
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,640
there are going to be two people... 

867
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,920
..crowned star baker. 

868
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,120
Firstly, the person who's shown consistency 

869
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,680
and good taste across the Bake Off this time. 

870
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,760
That person is Holly. 

871
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,400
- Well done.
- Well done, Holly. 

872
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,040
And secondly, rising like a phoenix 

873
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,040
from the ashes of his lebkuchen, 

874
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,840
- it's Jason.
- Well done, Jason. 

875
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,240
Well done. Congratulations. 

876
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,320
Now comes a slightly more onerous task. 

877
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,920
You know what has to happen now. 

878
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,160
The judges agreed that this week just one person would leave us. 

879
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,800
And that person is... 

880
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,240
..Ben. Sorry, Ben. 

881
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,840
The rest of you, we shall see you next week when it all begins again. 

882
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,280
I'm just disappointed. 

883
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,400
He's had a pretty diabolical week. 

884
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,560
His macaroons were terrible. His ginger nuts were far too hot. 

885
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,160
He was fourth from bottom with the brandy snaps. 

886
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,080
They were too thick and too dark. 

887
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,520
It's sad, because in fact he'd done jolly well up until then. 

888
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,680
I am proud. And I know friends and family will be proud of me as well. 

889
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,720
I am going to enjoy being star baker, 

890
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,600
especially because it's a joint star baker this time. 

891
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,600
It's nicer because you share the victory with someone. 

892
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,560
My mum will be chuffed when I tell her I'm star baker again. 

893
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,720
Especially with all that's happened this particular weekend, 

894
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,480
she'll really be excited about it. 

895
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,160
I feel, phew. 

896
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,160
I'm quite relieved to still be in it 

897
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,680
but at the same time I'm now thinking about next week and getting stressed about that. 

898
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,840
Next time, the bakers take on pies... 

899
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,120
Your pastry is excellent. It's flaky. It's buttery. 

900
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,280
I'm actually not comfortable with any of this recipe. 

901
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,920
- ..showcasing their signature family pie...
- The chicken is overcooked. 

902
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,800
You just can't taste anything. This is bland. 

903
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,000
...miniature pork pies in the technical challenge... 

904
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,360
There's something not right with the colour. 

905
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,680
I'm really worried about the time, I'll have to work really fast. 

906
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,880
..and show-stopping meringue pies. 

907
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,040
- I was really pleased with mine until I saw yours.
- What a mess. 

908
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,720
I can't fault it. 

909
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,560
- But who will become the next star baker?
- Bam. 

910
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,920
And whose Bake Off is about to end?
