00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off Masterclass. 

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,120
Judges Mary Berry and I will be doing the baking. 

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,760
We'll guide you through challenges faced by the bakers in this year's Bake Off. 

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,120
We will show you some little tips and tricks that will help you at home to create something magical. 

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
From the mixing, to the baking, to the finishing, 

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,480
to the presentation, at home you will get the same results. 

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Coming up, my luxury pork pies 

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,360
encased in notoriously-difficult-to-handle hot water crust pastry, 

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,760
filled with the perfect combination of pork loin and a quail's egg. 

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,920
Mary Berry's chocolate roulade recipe. 

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Mary will show you how to get the perfect roll every time. 

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,400
My traditional iced fingers - a complex combination 

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,040
of sweet yet buttery dough, precisely piped with whipped cream and strawberry jam. 

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,520
And Mary's Sachertorte - a technically tricky, dense chocolate cake 

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,240
with its signature glossy ganache icing. 

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,840
'Over the course of eight weeks 

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,800
'earlier this year, Mary and I saw twelve of the country's 

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,640
'very best home bakers go head-to-head as they fought it out to be crowned 

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
'Britain's best amateur baker. 

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,440
'Together, Mary and I devised the three challenges in each round...' 

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,880
- That's very, very good. 
- Absolutely delicious. 

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,760
'..and the technical challenge was the trickiest of all.' 

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
They come in all shapes and sizes, don't they? 

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
- Some of them are a bit irregular. 
- Good gracious! 

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,880
Eleven really lovely tarte au citron. 

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Because the recipe was always a surprise on the day, 

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,440
the bakers had no chance to practise and had to rely completely 

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,960
on their own knowledge and skill to get a good result. 

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,680
'Week five of the competition was all about pies, showcasing the bakers' pastry skills, 

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,680
'but also showing us their understanding of the balance of flavours. 

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,760
'For the technical challenge, I chose a first for The Great British Bake Off.' 

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,400
We're going to ask you to make a batch of six miniature pork pies. 

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
And in each pie we'd like there to be one quail's egg 

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,160
and, for the first time in this competition, we're going to ask you to work with hot water crust pastry. 

35
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,520
Pork pies with quails' eggs in the middle and hot water crust pastry. 

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,880
Yes. I chose this as a technical challenge because it's quite tricky. 

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,440
Once you've got the hot water crust pastry made, 

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,320
then it's all about rolling it out. 

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,360
Then you've got to do the filling for it, put the quail's egg 

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
right in the middle, put the lid on, 

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,640
crimp it, egg wash it and then, finally, you've got to get that bake bang on. 

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,400
So, we're going to start with the hot water crust pastry. 

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
We need to weigh up the flours. 

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,920
So, I'm using two types of flour - 

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,000
plain flour and strong flour. Overwhelmingly plain flour. 

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
In fact, 200 grams to 40 grams of strong. 

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,680
Gluten is the wheat protein in flour that gives the dough its elasticity. 

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,320
Plain flour contains less gluten than strong flour 

49
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,160
and is used when a crisper texture is needed in the finished bake. 

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,120
That little bit of strong will give it a bit of extra gluten to bind it together, 

51
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,240
to give it that quality, so when we're rolling it out, it stays quite rubbery, which is what you need. 

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,200
The next thing I've got is 50 grams of butter and 60 grams of lard, 

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
- all right? A little job for you in a minute, Mary.
- Is it? 

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,320
- It's melting the lard in boiling water.
- Oh, I can just manage that. 

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,280
60 grams. You need to melt that in 100ml of boiling water. 

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,440
One teaspoon of salt in that water, please. 

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,240
In here, I've got butter and flour. 

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm just going to rub this flour. 

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm interested that you're using butter WITH lard. 

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,400
When I've ever made hot water crust pastry, I've used ALL lard. 

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,360
- Are you adding the butter for flavour?
- Unique flavour. It's better. 

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,760
The butter adds that quality of a little bit of dairy in there, 

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,880
that flavour of butter, which is good. 

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,000
- That's melted for you. 
- Thank you very much indeed. 

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, this needs to go in here. 

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Obviously, at this stage, it is going to be rather hot. 

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Well, the last thing you want is boiling hot fat in your hands. 

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,000
So, again, stir it round first, incorporating all the flour. 

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,520
And you can see, it's starting to turn into a proper paste now. 

70
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,280
I can touch that now. It cooled off as soon as it impacted on the flour. 

71
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,200
Make sure you rub round to get everything out of that bowl. 

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
Beautifully clean bowl. 

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,840
All on that lump. 

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm just going to put a little bit of flour there, cos it's going to take a bit of working, 

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,520
just into a ball, so it's more of a smooth paste. 

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,760
- Just gently work it. 
- So, that's to work in the fat evenly? 
- That's right, yeah. 

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,520
Hot water crust pastry requires the mixture to be hot rather than cold, 

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,000
so as to make the dough easier to roll out. 

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,040
The large quantity of liquid used produces a hard, strong finish, 

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,160
making it suitable for holding heavy mixtures. 

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm just going to begin to start flattening. 

82
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,240
And now it's essentially been worked into a ball. 

83
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,800
- That's very good.
- Now, this one needs to be rolled out with a rolling pin. 

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,360
It's in there. Flatten it down with your fingers first as much as you can. 

85
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Flatten the dough lightly with your fingers and then roll out evenly 

86
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,360
with a rolling pin until three to five millimetres thick. 

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,040
All I'm doing, occasionally, is just putting a little bit of flour on. 

88
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll tell you why - 

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,800
it relaxes the dough, so it can skid back to where it should be. 

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I could roll this the size of this tray with no flour underneath 

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
and what'll happen is, when you put the lids in, it'll shrink back 

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
while it's trying to rest. 

93
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
And you're going to make it nice and thin, 

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,440
- that's where the bakers went wrong, some of them. They had it too chunky. 
- They had it too thick. 

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,000
'The bakers seemed a little thrown by my choice of recipe.' 

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,040
What's it say? Stirring till it comes together. 

97
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,920
Work into a ball. 

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Looks like a ball already. 

99
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm not going to risk using it all. 

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
That could be my downfall. 

101
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,160
'The trickiest stage was the all-important pastry. 

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,600
'Mary-Anne had never worked with hot water crust dough before.' 

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,000
It's quite odd working with something that's quite so warm. 

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,600
Normally, with pastry, it's supposed to be cold, cold, cold. 

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,240
'Jo made an early error with her pastry.' 

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
I got the flour wrong. 

107
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
But, hopefully, it's right now. 

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,240
'Holly was also unfamiliar with this type of pastry.' 

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,360
I don't get how this pastry works at all. It's rock hard. 

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,720
It's quite odd stuff. 

111
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,120
These are the trays that we're going to use. These are the trays that the bakers had. 

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
The main thing is they've got to have almost straight sides and not buntings that are sort of round. 

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
You don't want the shallow ones, you want straight sides. That's key. 

114
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,040
Six of these. 

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,000
Now, what I'm going to do, I need to make the cut for the base, 

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,200
obviously to line the base, to line the side, 

117
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,920
and then to line about 5ml to 10ml away from the edge of that. 

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Find something around the kitchen that will fit that size. 

119
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,040
- A small saucer you could run round. Something like that. 
- Yeah, that would be fine. 

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
Make sure it's relaxed. 

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,920
Get a little knife. Just cut gently round. 

122
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,440
You want to get it as smooth as you can. 

123
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,200
Press up against the side and get right down to the bottom. 

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,880
Get it down as much as you can. 

125
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,760
There's your overlap. There's plenty extra if you need it. 

126
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,360
You're pressing down and getting rid of all those folds, 

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,480
- but keeping the pastry very thin... 
- Yeah. 

128
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,040
- ..all the way round and the base. 
- Exactly. Exactly. 

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,480
- There is no need to grease the tins when you're making these pies? 
- Not these ones, no. 

130
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,160
This has got so much fat in this mix, 

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
it should just slide out anyway. 

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,920
The chances of this thing sticking are very rare. 

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,320
'Form the excess pastry back into a small ball. 

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,400
'Roll out again to the same thickness as before 

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,320
'and using a small cutter 

136
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,560
'cut out six lids large enough to just cover the top of your pie cases.' 

137
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,720
On the top of every lid, we need to have a hole, and that's to get the gelatine in later. 

138
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,080
If you get a little piping-bag nozzle, put it into the middle, 

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,360
make your hole, and then just gently open it up. 

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
It has to be quite a big hole 

141
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,240
in order to be able to pour the gelatine in? 

142
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes. Yes, it does. 

143
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
'Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper and lay the lids on.' 

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,280
These are going to go in the fridge now, just for about half an hour, 

145
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,480
just to chill down slightly, again harden the lard and the butter. 

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,600
'Placing the baking tray in the fridge helps firm up the pastry.' 

147
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,760
While they're chilling down, we're going to make the filling. 

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,240
This is some streaky, unsmoked bacon - 100 grams, 

149
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,640
and 300 grams of pork loin. 

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,600
Now, pork loin's got, obviously, very little fat in there, 

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
and that's the reason we add the streaky bacon - 

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,840
to add a bit of fat to it, a little bit of flavour to it, as well. 

153
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,080
It does make a difference in the pork pie. 

154
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,360
So, would you mind chopping up that as finely as you could, please? 

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
- I will. Nice and fine and I'll remove this bit of sinew here.
- Yes, lovely. 

156
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
Sinew pieces will never go tender... 

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
- Yeah.
- ..and I will just trim it off. 

158
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,880
Also, what's going in there, is an onion and a small bunch of parsley. 

159
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
I'd much rather cut this by hand. You get a better texture. 

160
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,080
If you did it in a processor, it could easily get like sausage meat. 

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,400
And every little piece is going to be tender, 

162
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,920
- because the loin is the most tender part of pork.
- Exactly, yes. 

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,760
The binding agent will be the pork. It'll bind everything together. 

164
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,600
You're looking for a dispersion of onion blended with pork 

165
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,280
and again, a good blend of the bacon in there 

166
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,600
and, finally, a little bit of zing coming from the parsley. 

167
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Was there a reason why you used unsmoked bacon? 

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
- Smoked bacon will just overwhelm everything.
- Oh, right. 

169
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,080
Essentially, the bacon's been added more as a fat, but again, it gives you a bit of flavour as well. 

170
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,400
- So, you don't want it to overwhelm the pork, but just balance with it. 
- And the seasoning? 

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Once I've blended it all, then I'll season it, yes. 

172
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
I use quite a bit of salt. 

173
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,080
The only seasoning, really, is actually going to come from the bacon. 

174
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,240
Do you know, at home, if I'm doing this, 

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,880
I am not too good at seasoning, because you can't taste it. 

176
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,800
So, what I do, is I take a little bit of that out 

177
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,840
and sort of squeeze it together 

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,240
and fry it in a little flavourless oil, and then taste it, and then you know 

179
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,560
- whether you've got the seasoning quite right.
- That's a nice tip. 

180
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,200
Give that a good mix, cos what you don't want is all that salt to stay in one place. 

181
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Then, the next job is quails' eggs. 

182
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,680
- Right. 
- I need to boil these quails' eggs. 

183
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Some of them had difficulty about boiling quails' eggs. 

184
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,400
- Apparently, yeah.
- They weren't quite sure how long to do them. 

185
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,720
I do mine, for hard boiled, two and a half minutes. 

186
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,400
How long do you boil a quail's egg for? Do you know? 

187
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,600
- No-one seems to know.
- Well... 
- How long do you boil a quail egg? Does anyone know?
- All I know... 

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,520
- is under two and a half minutes, cos this is overdone!
- Is it?
- Yeah. 

189
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,560
I don't know! Something so small, timing it right. 

190
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,200
And it must soft-boiled not hard-boiled cos they're going to cook again inside the pie. 

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,520
So, I think that's going to be very tricky. 

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,920
Are you ready? Jump up if you are. 

193
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,560
I've never boiled an egg before. 

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,520
- What, just a normal egg or just a quail's egg?
- A normal egg. 

195
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,160
- You've never boiled a normal egg before?!
- No. 

196
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,520
You can make a macaroon but you can't boil an egg? 

197
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,160
No. 

198
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,000
It's important, as soon as they're cool, to peel them. 

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,560
If you leave them for half an hour, it's difficult to get the shell off. 

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
So, that's the last one peeled. 

201
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,080
- There you are.
- Beautifully done. Thank you very much, Mary. 

202
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,240
OK, they're the shells and they're the lids. 

203
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,600
Now it's a case of putting it all together. 

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,400
Put your fingers into the side, encourage them to have a flat side where hits the base. 

205
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,840
While it's cold, it's the best time to do it. It'll give you a little bit more leeway, you know? 

206
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,960
- And, of course, it gives more room for the meat.
- Exactly, yeah. 

207
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,600
Take a spoonful of the mixture, drop it into the bottom. 

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,240
When that's in, you need to push that down to the bottom with your fingers. 

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
Push down the bottom, build up the mixture round the side. 

210
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
That is where the quail's egg will sit. 

211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,800
Paul, you've chosen to do six individual ones. 

212
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,560
Could you do these in a loaf tin? 

213
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,680
- Yes, you could. 
- Same amount of mixture? 

214
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,960
Yeah, same amount and again, you just build it up, put one on each, 

215
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,720
or use a proper egg, a full-size chicken egg and just put them all the way along. 

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
'Once all six quails' eggs have been placed, 

217
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,800
'fill the remainder of the cavity with the rest of the pork meat, 

218
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,200
'ensuring it's packed tightly around the sides and on top of the eggs.' 

219
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,720
It's really essential to press it down. 

220
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,680
I think some of them had some gaps through not pressing it down. 

221
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,040
Yeah. When we cut the pie open, you saw the egg floating round 

222
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,280
with a little bit of pork, because they never compressed all the pork down. 

223
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,720
Now, the next stage is to egg-wash it and then pop the lid on. 

224
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,200
Now, if we start here, all I'm going to do is just delicately brush a little bit of egg round here. 

225
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
And this is just so the lid can adhere to the base. 

226
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,000
So, now we're ready to put the lids on this. 

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,960
'Once the pies have been topped, 

228
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,520
'trim the edges with a knife to neaten and seal 

229
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,640
'with some decorative crimping.' 

230
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Fingers in, lift up the side. 

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,680
- You could do it with a fork if you're no good at crimping, couldn't you? 
- Yeah, course you could. 

232
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,240
'Top each pie with egg-wash and they're ready for the oven.' 

233
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,560
Going to go into a fan oven at 190 for 40 minutes. 

234
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,600
They look amazing. 

235
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,920
A lovely golden brown colour on top. 

236
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,880
What I want to do is pop a knife in there 

237
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,720
and just open that hole up a bit. 

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,200
Over in this pan, 

239
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,560
we've got 100ml of water, which is bringing up to the boil. 

240
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,640
In there, we've dropped one chicken stock cube. 

241
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,040
What I've got here is leaf gelatine. You can use the powdered gelatine, 

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
although this tends to be a bit easier 

243
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
cos it just softens in the water. 

244
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,640
Powdered gelatine you have to bring back with boiling water and dissolve it. 

245
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,760
I'll just squeeze the water out of there. 

246
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,000
And this will then go inside the stock and dissolve. 

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,280
It's pretty much instant with this stuff. 

248
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,800
'Once dissolved, 

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,840
'transfer to a jug and gradually fill the pork pie cavities.' 

250
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,800
You've got to be really careful, haven't you? 

251
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
And pour very, very gently and watch when it comes... 

252
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
- Yes.
- ..anywhere near the top. 
- Exactly. 

253
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,560
And then you need to chill them, preferably overnight, 

254
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,400
and the pure reason being is that you want to solidify that gelatine. 

255
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,120
But don't put these into the fridge until they're cold. 

256
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,920
You can't put warm pork into a fridge. 

257
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,640
Leave them out till they're cool, 

258
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
then pop them in the fridge overnight. 

259
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,480
In the morning, you'll end up with some beautiful pork pies. 

260
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,600
Like a battalion of little soldiers! 

261
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,720
'When it came to the judging, however, to be honest, 

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,720
'I was highly impressed.' 

263
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
I like the look of this. 

264
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
There's been some form of display. There's a pattern round the outside which looks nice. 

265
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
And it's got a good colour on it, as well. It's a good bake. 

266
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,280
I must say, I like that, the appearance. 

267
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,200
It looks homemade and inviting and it's lovely thin pastry. 

268
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,440
- Good flavour. I like that.
- So do I. 

269
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,720
It's a lovely thin crust. 

270
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
That's one of the things that's difficult to get right, 

271
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm sure you found. You're not too sure whether you've put your fingers 

272
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,080
into the very corner at the bottom to make it thin, as well. 

273
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
They look so tempting. 

274
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,320
I am dying to taste one. 

275
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,360
- There you go. 
- That does look very, very good. 

276
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,280
- You like?
- I am savouring every bit. 

277
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,520
It's nice, isn't it? 

278
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,120
Well, what I like is the pastry is really, really crisp. Mmm. 

279
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
In the sixth week of the Bake Off, 

280
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,920
we decided to test the bakers on their dessert-making skills. 

281
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,480
Our challenges included a baked cheesecake, 

282
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,000
the French classic croque-en-bouche 

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,440
and, for the technical challenge, 

284
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,880
Mary chose a classic recipe that really stretched our bakers. 

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,320
Today's technical challenge is... 

286
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,640
a chocolate roulade, 

287
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,960
A nice, thin sponge, neatly filled and neatly rolled. 

288
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,560
This is a difficult challenge, this one. 

289
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,200
So, Mary, why did you pick 

290
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,680
the chocolate roulade as a technical challenge? 

291
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Because I simply love it. 

292
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,080
It's good as a dessert and it's good as a special cake too. 

293
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,000
And this recipe is extremely light... it has no flour in. 

294
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,400
But it's quite tricky, so it's good to show everybody how to do it. 

295
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,760
The trickiness comes down to the actual folding 

296
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,760
and that's what makes it a special technical challenge. 

297
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,520
Exactly. It's difficult to roll, 

298
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,560
because you can end up by not getting a Catherine wheel effect. 

299
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,320
- Where do you want to start? 
- I want to start with the tin. 

300
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,520
Now, the tin is 23 by 33 centimetres and it wants to be straight-sided. 

301
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,760
And if you haven't got a tin like this, 

302
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,000
if your roasting tin is similar 

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
it'll work, you just need to line up the sides. 

304
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm using non-stick parchment. 

305
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,960
And you just fold it to, sort of, the size of the tin. 

306
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,480
Now, the tin needs to be buttered, 

307
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,560
- because you want the paper to stick to it, otherwise it'll slip.
- Yes. 

308
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,720
Then we come to the ingredients. 

309
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,280
First of all the chocolate. 

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,760
And we need 175 grams of that. That's six ounces. 

311
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
And I don't use one of the high cocoa content chocolate. 

312
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,400
If you use high cocoa content 70%, it really is too bitter. 

313
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,480
I agree. I think a lot of chocolate nowadays is very bitter. 

314
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,240
This is just the bar that you'll buy in the sweet shop. 

315
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,680
- Yeah.
- But it must be pure chocolate. 

316
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,600
And the way to melt that is not to be rushed. 

317
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,800
If you are in a hurry, you need to chop that up finely. 

318
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
If this pan is boiling, 

319
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,080
it will melt too quickly and you'll get a hard crust on it. 

320
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,880
So, gently, gently. Remember that chocolate melts in a child's pocket, 

321
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,080
so it doesn't need intense heat. 

322
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
- OK.
- Then we come to the eggs. I've got six eggs here. 

323
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,960
And I'm going to put the whites in here and the yolks in there. 

324
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,160
And you want to make quite sure that you get no egg yolk in with the egg white, 

325
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,320
because if you do, the egg whites won't whisk up to a full volume. 

326
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,640
The raising agent in this is the egg white. 

327
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,720
People that do have a problem with flour actually in recipes, 

328
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
this is an ideal one. 

329
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,520
Yes. And this is something that coeliacs can eat. 

330
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,360
Do you utilise these egg yolks at all? 

331
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,960
These egg yolks are going into the roulade. 

332
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,360
We're going to mix them with the sugar. 

333
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,720
But I start off by doing the egg whites, 

334
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,040
- then I don't have to wash the whisk in-between.
- Yeah. 

335
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,000
And then whisk on full volume until it'll look a bit like cloud. 

336
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,920
The egg whites need to be stiff, but not dry. 

337
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,160
This will take one to two minutes. 

338
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,800
That's just about right. 

339
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,800
It looks like cloud. 

340
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm going to tip the egg yolks into a bowl here. 

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,560
I need to whisk those with sugar. 

342
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,600
175 grams of caster sugar. 

343
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
In it goes. 

344
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,600
And I'm going to whisk those together. 

345
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
There's egg white on there. That doesn't matter. 

346
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
Put that in. Again, full speed ahead! 

347
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
As that is whisking, 

348
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,120
if there's a bit of egg yolk and sugar at the top, 

349
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,960
as there is on the top of that bowl, 

350
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,120
just scrape it down all the way round, 

351
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,680
or you'll get streaks in it. 

352
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,760
- That's it. And then not quite ready, so on full speed ahead again.
- Yeah. 

353
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,000
The mixture is ready after two or three minutes 

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,680
when thick and creamy in consistency. 

355
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,680
- Right, now you can see that it holds its shape.
- Yeah. 

356
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,360
It's called the ribbon stage. 

357
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,160
Next, add the melted and cooled chocolate 

358
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,760
and stir until combined. 

359
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
Now, I'm going to take some of the egg white. 

360
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm not going to fold the whole lot in at once, 

361
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,720
cos if you do that, it'll be streaky. 

362
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,240
- Yeah.
- I'm going to beat in a bit of the egg white. 

363
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,400
So, a couple of really good spoons going in there like that. 

364
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,440
So, this will slacken it down. 

365
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,640
And I'm beating that in and it'll make it a bit more runny. 

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
Now, that looks well included, 

367
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,640
those first two tablespoons in with the chocolate. 

368
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,560
It's quite smooth. 

369
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,200
And I'm going to add the rest all at once of the egg whites. 

370
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm going to tip that up and then put this in. 

371
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,360
So, this is the crucial bit really, isn't it, the roulade? 

372
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,400
- It is.
- You slacken it off first 

373
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,280
before adding the majority of the egg whites. 

374
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,880
And I'm going to fold that in, and folding is going round 

375
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,240
the edge of the bowl and then cutting through the middle. 

376
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,120
And that wants to be a very gentle movement. 

377
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,640
So, because the egg white is the rising agent, 

378
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
- you're trying to keep as much air in that as possible at this stage?
- Exactly. 

379
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
Exactly. There is no flour in here. 

380
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,400
If they don't incorporate all the egg whites into this mix, 

381
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,320
- you'll get this mottled effect within the sponge, of white?
- That's right. 

382
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,440
I know the consistency looks like it's split. 

383
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,120
It has those little sort of dots of... 

384
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,280
- Of moisture and then dry and moist and dry.
- Exactly. 

385
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,400
I've got the cocoa. I'm going to put two tablespoons in. 

386
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,480
Must sieve it, because we don't want it in lumpy. 

387
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,840
And don't mistakenly put drinking chocolate in, 

388
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,200
because that would be a very weak flavour. 

389
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,240
But it is the cocoa that stabilises the mixture. 

390
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,480
You'll get a good rise and it'll be a little bit firmer. 

391
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,880
As well as adding richness to the flavour, 

392
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,360
cocoa powder has a binding quality that helps 

393
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,040
the ingredients to combine and create a firmer, more stable sponge. 

394
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,160
I know some recipes don't put any cocoa in. 

395
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,800
But I've tried all sorts to get the ultimate one 

396
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,280
and I think this one is the best. 

397
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,840
And then I'm going to fold that in just as I did before, 

398
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,000
round the outside of the bowl and cut through the middle. 

399
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,560
And only mix until it is... 

400
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,240
everything has just included. 

401
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,880
- Don't over-mix it.
- Yeah. 

402
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,160
Once you've mixed this, you've got to put it in the tin 

403
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,840
and bake it straightaway. 

404
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,200
Once the mixture is in the tin, 

405
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,160
it needs to be baked straightaway so no air is lost. 

406
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,560
And then push the mixture into the sides. 

407
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,640
If you don't push it into the sides, it won't rise evenly. 

408
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,040
You're looking for a nice, 

409
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
- even layer so the roulade is nice and flat and square.
- That's right. 

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,760
So, that wants to go in the oven at 160 fan 

411
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,440
and that will take about 20 or 25 minutes. 

412
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,600
Bake the roulade until it's risen and starting to come away 

413
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,480
from the sides with a firm and crisp top. 

414
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,120
That looks just right. 

415
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,600
It's got a crust on top. 

416
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,360
It does slightly sink and expect it to. And it is well risen. 

417
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,120
- And all we've got to do now is let it get cool.
- OK. 

418
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,680
It must be cold before you put the cream in, 

419
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,160
otherwise the cream seeps into the mixture and also it melts. 

420
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,600
- Yeah.
- So, we'll let that get cold. 

421
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,680
Mary's roulade recipe was a great choice 

422
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,520
and allowed our bakers to showcase their knowledge. 

423
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,800
So, listen, have you made a roulade before? 

424
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,920
I have, back in the day at school. It was my nemesis! 

425
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,120
Jo clearly knew the secret of how to mix a roulade. 

426
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,760
You can knock the air out of them. 

427
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,800
They need to be really light and airy. 

428
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,680
Janet had her own technique, 

429
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
which proved she knew her stuff. 

430
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,400
I don't want to take any of the air away by patting it too much. 

431
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, go on, get in the corner. 

432
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,560
And Holly demonstrated her understanding of the science of the sponge. 

433
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,080
It's a little bit uneven, but that's the problem with fatless sponges. 

434
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,160
I think they're quite hard to smooth over 

435
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,800
cos they don't have that fat to kind of even out as it, as it melts. 

436
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,360
Once cooled, it's ready for the filling. 

437
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,280
Take 300ml of double cream and whisk until thick. 

438
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,440
Important to have a double cream that pours. 

439
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,160
- Mm-hm.
- Look out for the word 'pouring' on the side of the pack. 

440
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,200
What it is to have such force. 

441
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,880
I think I'll stand to one side while you're doing that. 

442
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,080
It's unlikely that you'll over-whip when you do it by hand. 

443
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,600
If you do it with a machine, 

444
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,800
the machine easily over-whips and then it would separate. 

445
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,880
That looks the perfect consistency. 

446
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,840
Really firm. 

447
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,760
I thought that might be coming over my head, yes. 

448
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,480
Right, so, we're going to turn this out. 

449
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,840
Take another piece of paper, and this is non-stick, 

450
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,400
put it on the worktop, 

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
and then a little icing sugar over the top. 

452
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,760
You can do this with a sieve or you can do it with a shaker. 

453
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,040
And there'll be a cloud of icing sugar 

454
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,560
which will come all over us, so watch out. 

455
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,280
So, just take hold of that and give it one bold tip. 

456
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,920
- Yeah.
- One, two, three, over. 

457
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,160
Remove the tin and carefully peel away the baking paper, 

458
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
before topping with the cream. 

459
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,120
Now, I've chosen to put whipped cream in here. 

460
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,640
You could also put some chopped strawberries, raspberries. 

461
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,000
- Cherries.
- Cherries. Stoned cherries. 

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,800
- Yeah.
- But, of course, if you're going to freeze it, 

463
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,120
you would freeze it just with cream in. 

464
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,680
- And, believe it or not, it freezes beautifully.
- Really? 

465
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,880
Just spread that over, 

466
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,680
right to the edges. 

467
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,200
Now, the rolling up is the part I enjoy. 

468
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,160
- It's the part that a lot of people are terrified of.
- Mm-hm. 

469
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,280
I'll give you a foolproof way of doing it. 

470
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,200
To get a tight roll, you take a knife 

471
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,800
and you almost cut through about half an inch from the end. 

472
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,680
And then you break that, absolutely break it, 

473
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,840
because I'm expecting loads of cracks. It's part of its charm. 

474
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,560
So, get hold of that and physically break it all the way along there. 

475
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,200
- And that is the middle of the sort of Catherine wheel...
- Yeah. 

476
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
..and it's what you do for the best result. 

477
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,800
Pick up the paper, hold it and then just gently make that go round. 

478
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,760
Now, this is cracking all the time that I do it, 

479
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,920
and as I'm turning it, I'm pressing the cracked bits back in. 

480
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,480
And quite firmly. 

481
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,680
- Can you see I'm doing that quite firmly as you go.
- Yeah. 

482
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,840
Our bakers had a real problem with this 

483
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,240
because they were nervous about, quite rightly, rolling it up. 

484
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,880
Janet forgot the crucial element, icing sugar on the baking parchment. 

485
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,400
It's the only way of preventing the sponge from sticking. 

486
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,360
Ahh! I should have put icing sugar or caster sugar on the bottom, 

487
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,480
cos of the fudginess of it. 

488
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,840
How absolutely ridiculous to make a stupid error like that. 

489
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,960
This doesn't even count as a roulade. It looks like a disaster area. 

490
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
This is the scary bit. 

491
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,120
Ooh, and it's cracking! 

492
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Needs a corset! 

493
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,520
That's what it needs. 

494
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,520
Doesn't look like it's done yet. 

495
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,680
Holly wasn't too pleased with the finished result. 

496
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,720
Oh, dear. Doesn't look great, does it? 

497
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,360
I need some Mary Berry advice, that's what I need! 

498
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,880
Push that again and more cracks. 

499
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,920
To ensure perfect presentation, 

500
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,920
finish the last roll of the roulade on your serving plate. 

501
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
Top with a final dusting of icing sugar 

502
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,120
and neaten by trimming both ends. 

503
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,280
- Aha.
- And there it is. 

504
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,800
And you should have a nice, tight spiral 

505
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,440
like a Swiss roll, like Catherine wheel. 

506
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
What you've showed us today is certainly... 

507
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,680
you can see where they've slipped up. 

508
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,800
And if they'd followed some basic rules, 

509
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,440
they would have ended up with something as perfect as that. 

510
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,560
In the blind tasting, 

511
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,600
we were looking at the execution of the roll as well as the taste. 

512
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,280
I quite like the look of this one! 

513
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,400
- It's quite tasty. 
- Mmm, it's very good. 

514
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,080
- It has broken up a lot.
- It's not bad.
- But they've tried to do a swirl. 

515
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,200
The overall appearance of it looks quite nice, though. 

516
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,360
- The flavour's good.
- Flavour's good. 

517
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,280
Now, this one looks nice. Slightly cracked. 

518
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,520
- It's got a nice taste.
- Mm. 

519
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,840
There's a little bit of a bend there. A little bit of a curl. 

520
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,080
- Yeah. This one's made quite a bit of effort to get a good roll.
- Yeah. 

521
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,280
I enjoy chocolate roulade. 

522
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,560
I think it's just a fantastic and beautiful-looking thing. 

523
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,600
It just looks gorgeously filled with all that cream 

524
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
and I think the informality of the cracking just is tempting. 

525
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,240
It's quite a dense sponge, but the flavour's in there, 

526
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,120
that lightness which the meringue adds to it. 

527
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,160
- Then you have that beautiful cream that lifts it to another level. 
- I think it's a winner. 

528
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
In week seven, the bakers reached the semi-final. 

529
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,080
Precision and finesse would be the key. 

530
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,080
It was my turn to set the technical bake and, even if I say it myself, 

531
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,120
what a brilliant choice my favourite childhood sweet treat proved to be. 

532
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,520
Today's Technical Challenge is one of my all-time favourites - 

533
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,720
iced fingers. 

534
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,240
12 identical fingers, filled with cream and jam. 

535
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,480
So, Paul, why have you chosen these iced buns 

536
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,000
- for your Technical Challenge? 
- I grew up with them 

537
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,920
and they're one of my favourite things I've had in a bakery. 

538
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,040
My dad used to be pretty good at them. 

539
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,160
I bet you've chosen it 

540
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,680
cos there's plenty of time for people to go wrong. 

541
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,040
There are a few stages that you can go wrong, 

542
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,800
but it's down to the rolling stage and dough stage. 

543
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Right, to start with, I need 500 grams of strong white flour. 

544
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,040
Can't use plain flour, you have to use strong. 

545
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Plain flour's for biscuits and crackers. 

546
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,480
- BOTH:
- And cakes.
- You almost forgot that.
- Ha-ha, you see! 

547
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,400
And strong flour is for bread. 

548
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,400
Strong flour is best for baking breads and recipes 

549
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,120
where yeast is used, as it ensures a good, even rise and crumb structure. 

550
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,160
500 grams of flour straight in the bowl. 

551
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,360
Mm-hmm. 

552
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,640
The next thing I'm going to add is my yeast, and I'm using... 

553
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,360
instant or fast-action yeast, and here, I've got 14 grams. 

554
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,080
Straight in to the side. 

555
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,040
The next thing I'm going to add in is 40 grams of butter. 

556
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,720
Is that salted butter or unsalted butter? 

557
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,920
- For this you can use either and I'm using unsalted.
- Mmm. 

558
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,280
And then I'm going to put in ten grams of salt, 

559
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,640
just normal cooking salt. 

560
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,760
Salt goes in opposite to the yeast. 

561
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,200
It's a nice little tip this. 

562
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Salt on yeast will certainly retard it if not kill it. 

563
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,480
So, you blend the yeast in first, then blend the salt in. 

564
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,440
OK. The next thing to go in is caster sugar. 

565
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,240
And you want 50 grams of caster sugar in there. 

566
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,600
The reason why I'm using caster sugar is actually because... 

567
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,480
you don't want to feel the grains inside the dough. That's the only reason. 

568
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,040
And then I've got two eggs to go in there as well. 

569
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,000
- Whole eggs?
- Yes, whole eggs. 
- You don't have to beat them? 
- No, you're fine. 

570
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Two eggs straight in. Next thing to add is your milk and your water. 

571
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,240
Now, over there, I've got 150 mil of warm milk. 

572
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,560
Milk tends to slow yeast down. 

573
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,880
So, if you warm the milk up a little bit, 

574
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,720
it'll act as a starter for the yeast, so it'll get growing. 

575
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,000
The next thing I'm going to is add the water. 

576
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,680
I've got 140 mil of water. 

577
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,360
Hold some back, and I'll show you why. 

578
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,440
To start with, 

579
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,480
- here we go, I'll move this out of the way.
- Action. 

580
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm going to get really messy, you know? 

581
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,400
Get your hands in and just stir with your fingers to start it off. 

582
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,640
Could you do this in a mixer if you wanted to? 

583
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
You could. I prefer to use my hands. 

584
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,480
Now, this is really a conventional dough, so it's not too wet. 

585
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,280
You can see there you've still got some residue flour that needs picking up. 

586
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,920
That's when you put the rest of the water in. Put a little bit in there. 

587
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,160
And at this stage, it's coming together. See? It's become one ball. 

588
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,920
- Yeah.
- It's ready to tip out onto a lightly floured surface. 

589
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,160
A dusting of flour on it. 

590
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,360
Get your dough. Pop it in there. 

591
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,720
I've compensated to the fact that people will add flour into that. 

592
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,880
That's why you start with a wetter dough, OK? 

593
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,680
Now, begin just by turning it, rolling it over like this. 

594
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,960
Flip it over, roll, roll, roll. 

595
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
Look at the muscles going! 

596
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,920
What I'm trying to do is incorporate the eggs, the butter 

597
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,360
and everything into that dough to get it smoother. 

598
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,200
- Those people who've got bread making machines...
- Yeah. 

599
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,040
- could they do this in there?
- Yeah. 

600
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,840
What I'm doing is just building up the gluten. 

601
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,960
The gluten is now releasing from the flour particles, 

602
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,280
going into the dough, and forming, you can see there, 

603
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
the stretches that you see, where the dough's beginning to split? 

604
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,280
- Mmm. Yeah.
- That is the beginning... 
- Let me feel it.
- ..of the gluten. 

605
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,800
- Yeah. It's still quite a wet dough, isn't it?
- It is. 

606
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,240
Yeah, well it's a soft dough. 

607
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,440
It's a soft dough rather than a wet dough. And then begin to stretch. 

608
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,040
See, I'm just holding the back. 

609
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,960
You pummel at that for at least five to ten minutes. 

610
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,200
And this dough will begin to get smoother and smoother. 

611
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,280
All the sugar will begin to dissolve. 

612
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,880
It will become more glutinous. 

613
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,640
You've got a nice, soft dough there that's well incorporated. 

614
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,680
- That goes back into your bowl. 
- Right. 

615
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,160
- Would you Clingfilm that for me, please?
- I will. I've got cleaner hands. 

616
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,600
Yes, it just prevents the dough from skinning. 

617
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,400
So, what is happening at the moment, the yeast is beginning to eat, 

618
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,160
feed itself on the flour. 

619
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,280
And then it'll exhaust itself, so it'll grow, grow, multiply, get bigger. 

620
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,520
You need to leave it for about an hour and a quarter. It'll then at least double in size. 

621
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,480
- And you just put the Clingfilm over the top?
- Yeah. 

622
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
Leave it in an ambient temperature. Normal household conditions. 

623
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,920
Room temperature's around 20 Celsius. That's perfect. 

624
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,560
Proving is the pre-baked period, 

625
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,680
where yeast reacts with the liquid and flour to produce carbon dioxide, 

626
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,760
causing the dough to rise without heat. 

627
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,880
So, Paul, this has risen like Vesuvius. 

628
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,080
It's huge cos of the heat in here. 

629
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,800
You've got to be careful when you peel this off. 

630
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,000
That's the structure of the gluten we built up when we kneaded it. 

631
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,040
- Right.
- And this has proved up. Proving, rising, it's the same. 

632
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,320
Now, I heed to tip this out onto a floured surface. 

633
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,120
Run your finger round it 

634
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,000
and dig all of this lovely, soft dough out. 

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,520
Now, I need to coat this. 

636
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,720
A bit of flour. 

637
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,000
Cos as it rests, or proves, it actually gets softer. 

638
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,680
Even softer. 

639
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,120
Now, I need to divide this... 

640
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,560
into 12. So, just divide in half. 

641
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
And again. 

642
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,320
- And again.
- And each in three. 
- Yeah, each one into three. 

643
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,040
To ensure perfectly even-size fingers, you can weigh the dough. 

644
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,440
Each piece needs to be 70 grams. 

645
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Get each one and you just ball it up. 

646
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Turn it on the table...and a ball. 

647
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,880
Shape all 12 pieces into balls, 

648
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,240
then hand-roll into fingers, approximately five inches in length. 

649
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,320
Place in two rows of six on a non-stick baking tray. 

650
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,400
Again, gently roll them out first, and they're nice and equal. 

651
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
That goes on the tray. 

652
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,160
- They look beautifully even. 
- They're perfect. 

653
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Right, I'm going to put those to prove, 

654
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,960
but in our house, I'd have to put them away from the dog. 

655
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,880
The fingers need to prove for about 40 minutes until doubled in size. 

656
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,440
OK, Mary, here they are, fully risen. 

657
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,440
And you can see, if you touch it, they spring back. 

658
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,120
- They've risen, so they all touch each and will have soft sides.
- Exactly. 

659
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,640
OK, Mary. These are going to go in the oven now for 10 minutes. 190 fan or 210 non-fan, all right? 

660
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,880
- Very hot, then? 
- Very hot oven and very quickly. 

661
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
Cos of the sugar and eggs in there, it will actually bake very quickly. 

662
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,920
But I want them to remain soft, which is why they're only getting 10 minutes. 

663
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,160
Here we are, Mary, cooled buns. 

664
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,280
They look a beautiful regiment. 

665
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,880
Got to then split these off. 

666
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,240
And, of course, there's the structure you're looking for. Nice... 

667
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,480
and soft. Smell that. 

668
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,480
It smells divine. 

669
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,680
It was a complex recipe with many stages. 

670
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,160
These fingers required meticulous and strict attention to detail. 

671
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,440
Mary-Anne took a very professional approach. 

672
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,240
Consistency is what they look for, especially in batches, and they want 12. 

673
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,400
And when the judges ask for a batch, they want consistency across the batch, 

674
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,040
which is why I'm taking the time to 

675
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,680
make sure that the dough is 

676
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,840
approximately the same weight - about 85 grams in each one. 

677
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,640
What's in a few grams? But they will make a difference. 

678
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,720
I just know he's going to have his eagle eye 

679
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,040
looking for unequal-looking buns. 

680
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,600
Here we are, Mary. Cooled buns. 

681
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,960
They look a beautiful regiment. 

682
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
Separate the fingers and leave them to cool whilst you make the icing. 

683
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,680
Icing sugar goes in, 200 grams. 

684
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,400
OK, I'm also going to add water. Do we get a spoon? 

685
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,360
'Course not. Use your fingers. 

686
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,000
Cos you get to feel the icing as well. 

687
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,200
I'd put a little bit more water in that - not a lot. 

688
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,320
The secret is not to get too much runny icing 

689
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,520
because it runs down the side. 

690
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,520
You'll need to use approximately 32 millilitres of water, 

691
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,440
or enough to achieve a loose but not runny consistency. 

692
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,160
So, what you're looking for is that. 

693
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,960
- See the way it holds its shape... 
- It's got a lovely shine, too. 

694
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,880
Exactly. And that holds. Once it's dripped once, it stops. 

695
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,920
And that's the texture you're looking for in the icing sugar. 

696
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,520
OK, get your bun, drop it in, 

697
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,040
wriggle it around a bit, 

698
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,560
lift it out, run your finger down it... 

699
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,320
There you go. 

700
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,520
'Once all the fingers are iced, 

701
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,320
'leave aside for a few minutes until set.' 

702
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,120
'When it came to the all-important finishing, 

703
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,480
'Jo really struggled cos her icing was far too runny.' 

704
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,520
- So, this was Paul's way? This is Paul's dipping? 
- Yes, this is dipping. 

705
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,280
I don't like the dipped look. I lost half of it on the table. 

706
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,040
It all dripped down. Try and tidy this up a little. 

707
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,160
Holly was well aware that consistency was key. 

708
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,000
It says in the recipe to dip them in the icing. 

709
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,680
And I don't think I can do that, 

710
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,840
so this is what I'm going to do instead. 

711
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm quite good at making things look the same. So, even if they don't taste that good 

712
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,640
I hope I'll get a couple of points for the fact that they look quite similar. 

713
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,480
Oh, it's blooming hard work! 

714
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,560
I didn't know how you could dip in to a thick paste, 

715
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,280
so I thought I would do what I hoped would be better... 

716
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,600
or as good. 

717
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,480
- OK, Mary, if I give you these four here...
- Right. 

718
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,080
..what I'd like you to do - 

719
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,680
a diagonal line about three-quarters of the way through. 

720
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,840
- A diagonal line.
- A diagonal line. 

721
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,880
- Just slice it down. 
- Below the icing?
- Yes. 

722
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,960
'Open up the fingers and pipe in a generous amount of cream.' 

723
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,280
You've made a few of these in your time? 

724
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,080
I've done a few of these in my time! 

725
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,160
'Finish by piping a line of jam across the cream 

726
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,680
'and top with a dusting of icing sugar.' 

727
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,240
There you go - some classic iced buns filled with cream 

728
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,760
and a line of jam. 

729
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,520
They just look absolutely mouth-watering. 

730
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,760
- We had very varied results, didn't we, in the icing?
- We did. 

731
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,800
Gosh, this is... 

732
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,280
- Don't they look good? 
- I'm pleasantly surprised. 

733
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,240
'Our judging all rested on presentation and the perfect bake. 

734
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,120
'This was, after all, the semi-final.' 

735
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,560
- Mmm.
- These are nice. Good, even bake. Icing's not bad. 

736
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,640
- Quite nice this zigzag finish here, isn't it?
- Mmm. 

737
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,600
Just done. Another minute or two less they wouldn't have been baked. 

738
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,960
That's a nice iced bun. The texture's good. 

739
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,680
It's soft. 

740
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,320
It's got an equal colour. 

741
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,520
It's beautiful. 

742
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,400
The icing hasn't covered the whole top, 

743
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,120
- but it's got a nice taste, hasn't it?
- Mmm!
- It's very, very good. 
- Absolutely delicious! 

744
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,720
Now, this one, it's got more of uniform icing on it, 

745
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,560
although the icing was a little bit too wet - 

746
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,000
that's why it's run down the side. 

747
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,360
I think you've done us proud. Those look absolutely wonderful. 

748
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,720
To be nice and coated all over, and then lots and lots of cream inside, 

749
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,120
and again a nice piping of jam. You don't need a lot of jam. 

750
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,080
Just one line just to balance up. They are beautiful things made properly. 

751
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,200
The texture of them is so soft. 

752
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,360
Using that enriched dough makes them beautiful. 

753
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,920
- Mmm.
- Do you like them? 
- They're nectar. 

754
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,080
- They're lovely, aren't they? 
- Mmm!
- Delicious. 

755
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,840
'By the final, I think the bakers knew the score. 

756
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,240
'That nothing but perfect baking and presentation would do in order for Mary and I to choose 

757
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,960
'who would crowned Britain's best amateur baker. 

758
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,120
'The final technical bake had to be the most demanding of the series, 

759
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,560
'so Mary selected a recipe that would give the bakers no margin for error.' 

760
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,400
Our technical challenge today is our hardest yet. 

761
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,040
It is the Sachertorte. 

762
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,400
You've got a really dense torte and on top we need to get a nice, 

763
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,240
shiny slick of chocolate ganache. 

764
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,080
Sachertorte, Mary. This was the technical challenge at the final. 

765
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,160
Why did you choose that one? 

766
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,600
I chose it because I don't think any of them had ever made it before. 

767
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,440
It's the ultimate cake that you would find in a very posh hotel 

768
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,040
and it is difficult to make. 

769
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,880
It's a one-tier cake with a very dense cake mixture, 

770
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,840
and the icing has to be really shiny. 

771
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,680
And also, it tested their piping skills 

772
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,160
because they had to write "Sacher" across the top 

773
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,680
and get the spelling right. 

774
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,120
So, Mary, how do we start to make this cake? 

775
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,920
First of all, the cake tin. 

776
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,120
This is a nine inch, 23 centimetre cake tin. 

777
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,440
It's got a loose base. And I've really well greased that. 

778
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,440
And then if you put a piece of non-stick paper in the bottom - 

779
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,760
that will make sure that we get it out. First of all, 

780
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,480
I start with the creaming mixture 

781
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,080
and I'd like 150 grams of unsalted butter. 

782
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,400
So, that goes into the mixing machine. 

783
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,120
And then 100 grams of caster sugar. 

784
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,200
And, of course, you use caster sugar rather than granulated 

785
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,400
cos you don't want any granules in the cake. 

786
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,000
- Turn that on just to mix it for a moment, then add the caster sugar.
- Yeah. 

787
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,400
'The mixture will be ready after two or three minutes, 

788
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,920
'once the sugar is combined and the texture is light and thick.' 

789
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,400
That looks absolutely fine now. 

790
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,000
It's a lot whiter, it's beautifully creamy and it'll be less granular from the sugar. 

791
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,480
The next thing to go in is melted chocolate, 

792
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,040
and I've got 150 grams. 

793
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,160
It's plan chocolate. It's not the posh 70%, 

794
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,360
- it's 39% cocoa solids.
- OK. 

795
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,840
And I melted it over the top of a pan of hot water. 

796
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,840
- Slowly I've taken it off and it's just got to the pouring stage.
- OK. 

797
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,880
If you put it in hot, of course it would melt the butter and the sugar. 

798
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,080
At the same time, I'm going to put vanilla extract in 

799
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,920
and I'm going to use half a teaspoon. 

800
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,880
- It smells lovely, doesn't it? 
- It does. 

801
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,200
'Whisk until the chocolate 

802
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,000
'is fully incorporated and the colour is even.' 

803
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,240
That, to me, looks well whisked. 

804
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,920
Now we add the eggs. 

805
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,720
Five large eggs, please. 

806
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,560
First of all, I'm going to separate the eggs. 

807
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,760
Do it very carefully cos you don't want to get 

808
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,800
the yolks and the whites mixed. 

809
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
Put the yolks in there, the whites in here. 

810
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,360
Obviously, five eggs in this relatively small mix 

811
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,240
is quite a lot of eggs. It's going to be very, very rich. 

812
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,920
It's very rich, it's very dense, but that's all part of its charm. 

813
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,960
I'm going to add the egg yolk and I shall turn this on full speed. 

814
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,760
'Add the egg yolks one at a time. 

815
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,240
'Once all are combined, sieve in 55 grams of plain flour.' 

816
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,080
The reason I'm sieving the flour, Paul, is it's an expensive cake 

817
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,400
and I'm just taking every precaution that it's perfect. 

818
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,280
And also, we're going to add some ground almonds. 

819
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,560
It almost acts like a binding agent just to pull the mix together? 

820
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,400
It stabilises the mixture and will help it to keep. 

821
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,120
This cake is much better eaten the day after. 

822
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,560
And the ground almonds also add to the denseness. 

823
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,600
So, in that goes, 75 grams. 

824
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,520
And, at this stage, it's folding it in. 

825
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,480
So, round the outside of the bowl 

826
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,680
and fold it in, and it will be very stiff at this stage. 

827
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,600
- What liquid is left to go in this, then? Egg white? 
- Just egg whites, that's all. 

828
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,640
And fresh egg whites give much more volume. 

829
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,840
An older egg white is runny when you crack it 

830
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,520
and you can't get such a volume. 

831
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,240
Whisk it up until it looks like cloud. 

832
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,760
So, again on full speed. 

833
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,200
Now, this is not ready, but I just want to show it to you. 

834
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,280
This really hasn't got full volume yet. It's still rather yellow. 

835
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,960
It will get a bit whiter than that and it'll be sort of soft peaks. 

836
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,760
But it just needs a bit more. You can over-whip it at this stage. And, if so, 

837
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,040
it breaks into pieces in the top of the bowl. 

838
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,720
'Whisk the egg whites for a couple of minutes 

839
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
'until they're stiff but not dry.' 

840
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,400
That looks just what I'm wanting. 

841
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,440
So, we've got plenty of volume there 

842
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
and I'm going to take about a third of that into here. 

843
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,760
I think that's just about a third. 

844
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So, I'm beating that in. 

845
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,200
- This just slackens down the mix to allow you to put the rest in. 
- Exactly. 

846
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,600
So, I'm going to take the rest of the egg white 

847
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,120
and put that in in one go. 

848
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,160
This is the key stage, I think, 

849
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,160
when you're starting to fold in lightly the last bit of meringue. 

850
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,920
Once you've slackened off the mix, 

851
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,920
the addition of the extra essentially air 

852
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,680
being added to a slacker mix would then retain the air. 

853
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,560
Adding it to a thicker mix in one bulk would just decimate the air bubbles 

854
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,000
- and therefore give you a flatter Sachertorte as well. 
- Exactly. It's coming through. 

855
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,040
I'm doing it carefully and slowly. 

856
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,320
And, if you want to, you can make the actual base of the Sachertorte 

857
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,760
a day before or two days before and then ice it when you want it. 

858
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,040
So, all that mixture out in more or less one blob, 

859
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,400
and then you're not taking the air out of it. So, in it goes. 

860
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,120
And it's a perfect mixture, absolutely smooth. 

861
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,280
If you haven't mixed the egg white in properly, 

862
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,560
- what happens, it looks curdled.
- Yeah. 

863
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,880
Then, important to level this. 

864
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,600
It will not take its own level because it's a fairly stiff mixture. 

865
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,240
And try not to get it up the sides of the tin, 

866
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,080
because that'll just burn on the tin and also be difficult to get out. 

867
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,440
- It's not going to grow massively up the side of that, is it?
- No. 

868
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,120
It'll just be a little bit deeper. So, that's ready to go into the oven. 

869
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,800
- You should have your oven set, and it should be 160 fan.
- Yeah. 

870
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,280
That's 180 in a conventional oven. 

871
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,920
It'll take between 45 minutes and 50 minutes. 

872
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,920
It's got to be shrinking away from the sides of the tin. 

873
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,320
It has a slight crust on the top. 

874
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,240
If it does sink, it usually means that you've slightly undercooked it. 

875
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,920
'At this stage in the competition, 

876
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,080
'all the bakers were aware of exactly what they needed to do to impress us.' 

877
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,240
It's going to be quite a hard challenge and I haven't actually made one of these before. 

878
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,720
But I've made ganache and I have made a torte before, so, yeah, 

879
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
we'll see how it goes. 

880
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,000
'Mary-Anne had her own way of melting, or burning, chocolate.' 

881
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,960
I'm melting some more chocolate because the first lot burnt. 

882
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,840
'Mixing in the egg whites was no problem for Holly.' 

883
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,040
This first couple of spoons full are just to loosen, 

884
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,440
cos otherwise it's very, very hard to fold egg whites 

885
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,680
into a stiff cake mixture. 

886
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,400
'Jo was also confident she knew the tricks when it came to mixing.' 

887
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,160
Well, you just have to do these cutting motions rather than... 

888
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,720
You don't want to lose the air. 

889
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,960
It's... 

890
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,000
..OK. It's not completely level. 

891
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,400
- So, the cake is baked and it is level across the top.
- Yeah. 

892
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,240
I've freed it from the tin, still have the paper underneath, 

893
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,440
and this is absolutely cooled, and you just peel that off the base. 

894
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,320
With it being quite a robust cake, you can actually treat it 

895
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,920
a little bit harder. 

896
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,520
'Place on a serving plate and spread the cake 

897
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,040
'with gently warmed apricot jam.' 

898
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,360
Sieved apricot jam. Of course, you don't want to get that too hot, 

899
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,040
just enough to melt it. 

900
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,960
If it's really thick, you can add a little water to it. 

901
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,920
It just helps to seal in the moisture of the cake, doesn't it, with the apricot jam? 

902
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,720
Not only does it seal in the moisture, it means that 

903
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,080
any loose crumb is attached to the cake and doesn't get in and spoil the icing. 

904
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,760
- These little air bubbles in the top, can you just push them down slightly?
- Just press them down. 

905
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,920
And if you press it down and fill it with apricot jam, 

906
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,320
- that'll make it quite level.
- Yeah. 

907
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,040
'Allow the jam to set whilst making the icing.' 

908
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,160
- The icing is a, a chocolate ganache. 
- Yeah. 

909
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,200
And I'm going to put double cream - and it must double pouring cream. 

910
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,360
And that's 200 millilitres. 

911
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,120
'Ganache is a rich chocolate mixture commonly used as an icing or filling 

912
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,040
'and forms the base for chocolate truffles.' 

913
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,320
Then a plain chocolate, 150 grams. 

914
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,640
That's five ounces. 

915
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,800
- And we're using the same chocolate that went into the cake as well? 
- Exactly. 

916
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,400
There's steam coming up from the cream. Take it off the heat 

917
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,800
and tip the chocolate into that. 

918
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,840
That will just start to melt, and on no account put it back on the heat. 

919
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,560
It will naturally melt. It won't curdle, it won't separate. 

920
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,400
It's quite easy to do, but you must do it off the heat. 

921
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,240
'Once the cream and chocolate are well combined, 

922
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,360
'leave to cool for a few minutes until thickened slightly. 

923
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,520
'Then pour the ganache over the top of the torte.' 

924
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,560
- I'm just letting it take its own form.
- Mmm. 

925
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,040
Then I'm going to encourage it to slip down the front... 

926
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,640
..and all around, tilting it. 

927
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,760
I can just run along here, like that, and it will run down. 

928
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,560
If you haven't got it quite right, you're going to have to use a palette knife dipped in water. 

929
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,440
But I've been able to avoid that, 

930
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,680
because you do begin to lose the shine. 

931
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,080

- Yeah.

- That cake looks pretty well done as well.
- The cake looks very good.

Getting the apricot through, which is good.

I think it's a nice cake, that one. 

954

It's a nice cake - a little over decorated. 

955

Yeah. 

956
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,080
Now, this one, it's got the nice ganache on, this one. 

957
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,280
I think that could have done with a little bit longer bake. 

958

It's got more of a high mirror finish, which is what you're looking for for a Sacher. 

959
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,840
- These two could both have done with just a little more, five more minutes.
- Mmm. 

960
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
Made beautifully, Mary, may I say? 

961
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,240
I think the glaze that you've got on the top is stunning. I think the ganache was superb. 

962
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,760
- Proof of the pudding.
- Right. 

963
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,360
- Hmm!
- Mmm, that's a bit of all right, isn't it? Mmm, very good. 

964
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,080
Moist. Chocolaty. 

965
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,720
There is a definite zing of that apricot that's left on there as well, that sweetness sitting there. 

966
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,040
And again that almost fudge quality to that chocolate on the top. 

967
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,280
Mary, fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. 

968
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,960
This was the last of the technical challenges. A bit sad, really. 

969
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,120
It is sad, but I've really enjoyed these masterclasses. 

970
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,800
We've had plenty of time to go through every detail 

971
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,560
of the technical challenges, so everybody at home can make them. 

972
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,120
And all you need is a good pair of scales, good ingredients, 

973
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,880
and follow every single step, and success should be the result. 

974
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,280
I hope we've inspired everybody to get going. 

975
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,360
Get into the kitchen and start baking.
