1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We've got a treat in store for you over the next eight weeks

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,920
as we search for Britain's best amateur baker.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,600
12 of the very best are ready to fight for the ultimate crown.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,160
Elasticate those waistbands. It's the new series of The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,440
Thousands entered this year's nationwide search

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,600
for Britain's best amateur baker.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,960
I feel like somebody's going to say, "Could you go? There's been a mistake."

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,440
But just 12 of the most passionate and skilled have made it through

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
to battle it out in the Great British Bake Off.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,680
It's just like a dream come true, really. I'm so excited.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,760
Over the next eight weeks, they'll be creating everything

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
from cakes, pies, bread and biscuits,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,560
in challenges where every aspect of their baking skills will be pushed to the limit.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,480
Worse-case scenario, make a complete hash of it and cry on camera.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,800
Each week, those who fall short will be asked to leave.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,160
It's like a village fete on adrenaline, really.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,160
Only one can be crowned the winner of the Great British Bake Off.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
There is some amazing talent in this marquee. It's just phenomenal.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,080
Yes! Ah, ah, ah!

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,240
This year, the Great British Bake Off has found a home -

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,000
Valentine's Mansion, a 17th-century country estate that will play host

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to the next chapter in the nation's love affair with home baking.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
It's rolling pins at dawn.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
Yes, The Great British Bake Off is about to begin,

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,040
and where better a place to start?

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,560
This show is all about cake.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,040
The contestants are ready, and so are we. Excuse me.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,160
- It's research. 
- Where's mine?
- Get off.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,520
None of these 12 people have baked in such a competitive environment before,

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,760
but they're about to face three increasingly complicated challenges over the next two days,

31
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,040
after which one of them will be crowned this week's star baker,

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,520
and another will have to leave The Great British Bake Off.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Morning, all, and a massive welcome.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
We start as we mean to go on, with a challenge. This one is your signature bake,

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
so for this one we're asking you to show us tried and tested recipes.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
Nothing too off-piste. Now is not the time to experiment.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,120
We're looking for two hours of your finest baking,

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,760
producing 24 cupcakes, baked and iced,

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,520
to be judged by Paul and Mary.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,280
We're all going to be here together for the next two days,

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,760
at the end of which we will be saying goodbye to one of you.

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,040
For the first time - you'll hear this a lot in the next two days -

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
on your marks, get set...

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
BOTH: Bake.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,640
All the challenges in the bake off have been devised by acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood

46
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
and legendary cookery writer and baker Mary Berry.

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:10,040
As a judge, I'm looking forward to having really interesting detailed recipes

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,120
and, of course, they've got to taste just as good as they look.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,280
Mary and I want to find out who is the best amateur baker in this country,

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
and the way to do that, following from the last series, is to up the ante,

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,640
and that is exactly what we've done.

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,760
Their first challenge requires the bakers to achieve

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,760
consistency of size, texture and flavour across 24 individual cupcakes.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,040
They're allowed to create up to two varieties,

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,760
and each one of them must be perfectly decorated

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,160
and feature sponge and icing of different but complementary flavours.

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,280
Every one of them must be ready to be judged in two hours.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
At home, normally I've got all the time I need, really,

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,240
so I just meander into the kitchen and start baking,

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,000
and then it's finished when it's finished.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Jo lives in Essex and is a wife, mother and, at 41,

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,520
the youngest grandmother in the competition.

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,200
She's making her family's favourite chocolate and orange cupcakes.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,760
- Do you like cooking for your family? 
- I love it, yeah.

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,400
- Do you find it frustrating when all you get is a grunt?
- Yeah.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,200
Well, mine actually mark me out of ten.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,240
And they find it really amusing to mark me really low.

68
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,720
- Jo, I'm not having that.
- No. 
- So you cook a meal for them?

69
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,440
- Yes, and they go, "One out of ten".
- No!

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,240
- Or three, maybe six. Sometimes I feel like putting their head in the dinner.
- Yeah!

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,880
The base for a traditional cupcake sponge is made by creaming butter and sugar...

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
- What?
- ..then gradually adding beaten eggs, then flour.

73
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
This is me being neat, not me being untidy!

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,760
But the fats in these ingredients are prone to reject each other...

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,520
No! It curdled with the last egg.

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,040
..emulsifying the batter, rendering it lumpy and unusable.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,000
If the eggs aren't the same temperature as the butter, it ends up separating.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,040
But what you can do is add a tiny bit of the flour and it should be OK.

79
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
25-year-old Rob works as a photographer,

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,160
but dreams of becoming a professional baker in Paris.

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,040
A keen innovator, his cupcakes feature a fresh blackberry juice and vanilla sponge

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,400
with Pernod icing and a unique topping.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,160
- Is that liquorice there?
- It is.

84
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm going to cut it up fine and grate a bit on the top.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,400
And then the icing, you use this alcohol as well as the liquorice?

86
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,160
I reduce it and then the liquorice is to finish it off.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,520
- Have you been practising? 
- I've practised with the liquorice,

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,040
but I haven't mastered it.

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,520
When we say "signature bake, tried and tested"...

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,040
- When we say "tried and tested"... 
- You haven't tested it.
- I have a bit.

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
The bakers are free to add whatever ingredients they wish

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
to their toppings and sponges.

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm just trying not to cut my hand while I grate and chop.

94
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,040
But altering the consistency of their batter

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,880
by adding fruit or liquid at this stage is risky.

96
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,280
- Get a basic batter, that's fair enough.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,880
- But if you're adding liquid, make your batter slightly thicker.
- Yeah.

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
- Do you add more flour to combat it? 
- More flour.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,640
Or less egg. Then you can compensate when you add the rest of the stuff.

100
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,280
- But you've made these before, presumably.
- I have, loads of times.

101
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
40-year-old marketing manager Urvashi

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,560
is a self-taught baker and mother of two. She met her husband in the Far East,

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,760
the inspiration for her cherry blossom and Japanese lime cupcakes.

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,880
It's going to have lime zest in the base

105
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
to kind of just bring out the colour of the yuzu.

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,040
Yuzu is an East Asian citrus fruit

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,160
whose juice is widely used in Japanese cooking.

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
These come into season in winter,

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
and we used to pickle them and have them as a cool drink in the summer.

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
- Yeah.
- It's so amazing. 
- It's very aromatic, isn't it?

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,760
- I'm not doing anything else. 
- It's a cross between a mandarin and a lime.

112
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,440
Rugby roach Simon has opted for a less subtle addition to his batter.

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
At the moment I'm heating together caster sugar,

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Guinness and dark chocolate,

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,640
then I'm going to mix in egg whites and creme fraiche,

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,520
so it's fairly straightforward.

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,880
The 31-year-old ex-RAF officer lives in Norfolk with his wife and two sons,

118
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,880
but his signature cupcakes are more suited to his mates at the rugby club -

119
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,040
a Guinness and chocolate sponge topped with Bailey's and cream cheese frosting.

120
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,640
I'm a Guinness fan at heart, and it does work well with the recipe,

121
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,040
so they don't object.

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Filling cupcake cases correctly is an art.

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,640
The bakers have to be able to anticipate

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,040
how far their batters will rise.

125
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,800
Over-filling will create an unacceptable mushroom top.

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,880
Because everyone's putting me off.

127
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,520
Under-filling produces a small, dry, over-baked sponge.

128
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,760
It won't help me, panicking.

129
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Tapping helps to remove any trapped air bubbles,

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,040
which can balloon in the oven, ruining a cupcake's appearance.

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm weighing cupcake mixture like a crazy woman at the moment.

132
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,280
I would never, ever do this at home.

133
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,360
31-year-old Holly lives in Leicester with her husband and two children.

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,240
She's honed her baking skills whilst on maternity leave,

135
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,360
and aims to impress with 12 cupcakes inspired by the Bakewell tart

136
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,160
and 12 ginger cupcakes with homemade fig truffles.

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,040
It's obviously a bit nuts to weigh mixture before it's cooked,

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,040
but because it's a competition and I want all the cakes to be the same size,

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
then that's what I'm doing.

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
Where did my timer go?

141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,760
Where DID my timer go?

142
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,280
- 15 minutes.
- Say a little prayer.

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,680
To find out more about the history of cupcakes,

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,280
I've come to the beautiful Audley End House, Essex.

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,040
Conkers, hopscotch, having your head flushed down the toilet,

146
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,440
they're all classic childhood memories for me.

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,160
But nothing beats my recollection of the first fairy cake I ever baked,

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,600
which for so many kids is the original point of entry into the glorious world of baking.

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Fairy cakes, or cupcakes as they're also known,

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,520
were first made in the kitchens of these vast stately homes,

151
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,400
but would never have been possible

152
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
without the use of an unusual piece of kitchen kit.

153
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,760
So, Annie, what is this unusual piece of kit?

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm thinking sponge catapult. No?

155
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
Not really. What you're looking at is something as simple as the teacup.

156
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
- So this is literally why they're called cupcakes? 
- Yes. There are two arguments.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,520
One is simply this, they're baked in cups,

158
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,000
and the other is that the recipe often includes cups of things,

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,120
so it will often be a cup of sugar, a cup of flour, a cup of butter.

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,880
How did servants get their hands on crockery like that?

161
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Like anything, cups go out of fashion, so upstairs they're drinking from tea bowls.

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Then they start to get handled cups.

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,800
The tea bowls evolved down the household until they reached the kitchen.

164
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
The cook may well be drinking tea out of them,

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,120
and she looks for something to bake a small cake in,

166
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,800
throws in the mixture, and hey presto! A ready-made mould.

167
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
One of the first published cake in a cup recipes

168
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,480
was written by the famous British cook Maria Rundell in 1806.

169
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Her Queen cake contains three cups each of flour, sugar

170
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,040
currants, butter and some very frothy eggs.

171
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,560
I've expended less calories in a fitness DVD than I'm doing now.

172
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm presuming that all this exertion is to create

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,440
- a lightness of touch that'll be enjoyed upstairs.
- Absolutely.

174
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,840
This is the era where what we now know as the fairy cake is really invented,

175
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,360
and it's called a fairy cake precisely because it's so light.

176
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,680
So we're going to mix our well-whisked egg yolks in with our butter.

177
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,320
Now, at what point are aprons invented, because it may be time?

178
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,440
- I think we've got a strong argument to suggest way back in the medieval period.
- Let's do it.

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,560
Then we're going to mix in our egg whites,

180
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,840
and add in the dry ingredients, folding them in,

181
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,920
so what we end up with is something that's nice and light and airy

182
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
and will rise very well because of the whisking.

183
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,200
Then we're going to fill them about two thirds full,

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
- because they will rise.
- Let's bake.

185
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,600
Fairy cakes' popularity really took off as afternoon tea became more fashionable.

186
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
This tea house bridge was specially designed for ladies

187
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,840
to enjoy beautiful views and eat lots of small cakes.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
Marvellous.

189
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,680
I want to see the results!

190
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,200
They've been in the oven for about 30 minutes.

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,440
Look at that. Perfection, though I say so myself.

192
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,920
That is all your beating.

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,560
Yes, thank you. Look how light that is!

194
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,880
It's beautiful, curranty, sugary, light, eggy goodness.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,480
So did afternoon tea make these sorts of cakes more popular?

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,080
Very much so. Yes. The Georgian period is all about taste and gentility and refinement

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,440
and civilisation, and showing ourselves to be one of the most civilised nations on Earth.

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,640
So small cakes really are very useful,

199
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
both in terms of having something that's the right size

200
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,000
in proportion to the tea cup, but also having something

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,240
that isn't going to be unladylike in terms of what you're eating.

202
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,600
So you're saying all this gentility, this refinement,

203
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
all created by this shape and this drinking utensil.

204
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,880
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.

205
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,880
SUE SLURPS

206
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,000
- That's how they did it, isn't it? 
- SHE LAUGHS

207
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,480
'One hour to go in the signature cupcake challenge.'

208
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
I want them to go brown, but they're not going brown,

209
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,040
and I keep turning it up a little notch.

210
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
'Oven timing for cupcakes is critical.'

211
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm so scared to leave them in there too long.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,160
'Their small size means the margin for error is tiny.'

213
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,880
It would be a couple of minutes.

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,040
'As little as one minute either side of the optimum time can produce

215
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,840
'an underdone, doughy texture or dry them out completely.

216
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,800
'They must also remember to turn them

217
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,360
'to make sure the batch is baked evenly.'

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,840
Whoops. Note to self -

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,600
don't poke the uncooked cupcake, because it will sink!

220
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,640
If this thing's right, it says they're baked.

221
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,760
Technology wouldn't be wrong, would it?

222
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,200
When you do it at home, it doesn't matter if it doesn't work, you know.

223
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,560
People eat them anyway.

224
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,640
Here, I've got the queen of cooking tasting them, so, you know,

225
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,760
if they don't work out, she's going to say, "What on earth are you doing here?

226
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,480
- "Get lost!".
- Liverpudlian and grandmother of three, Janet,

227
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,240
is never without a home-baked cake in her house.

228
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,720
For her signature cupcakes, she's miniaturised her favourite recipe

229
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,480
for fresh raspberries and cream cake.

230
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,720
- Looking very flippety-flop. 
- They're looking flippety-flop?

231
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,120
- Don't look, please. 
- It's a bit late for that. Was the batter quite a wet mix?

232
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
- It was quite liquid.
- Get them out of there as soon as you can,

233
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
put them on a cool surface as quickly as possible.

234
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
The cool surface will prevent them from dropping,

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,320
because you're rapidly cooling off the inside.

236
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,040
Did you add baking powder to these?

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,080
- I did.
- Sometimes, if you use too much baking powder,

238
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,520
it rises up and then drops down again.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah. Well, it was the recipe.

240
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,720
I don't normally make cupcakes because I normally make just one great big cake for the masses.

241
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Has the pressure got to you? Are you feeling nervous?

242
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, I wasn't until these came out! No.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
They look great in there. Hope they don't sink at the last minute, like they sometimes do.

244
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,200
Am I ready like Freddy? In a Chevy on the levee, drinking a bevvie...

245
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,520
19-year-old engineering student, Jason, is from Croydon

246
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,600
and is a passionate member of his university's baking society.

247
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,240
He's baking 12 lemon meringue cupcakes and 12 apple and cinnamon cupcakes

248
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,520
with a technically challenging topping that he hopes will impress.

249
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm separating my eggs, half for the meringue and half for the creme patissiere.

250
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,280
'A creme patissiere is a cooled custard created by carefully adding beaten eggs, sugar and flour

251
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,040
'to milk infused with fresh vanilla or extract.'

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,480
- Ooh, this stuff is potent, boy. 
- 'The mixture must be continuously stirred over a moderate heat.

253
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,520
'This warms the fat, causing the mixture to thicken,

254
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
'making it suitable as a filling or topping.

255
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,920
'Too much heat can cook the eggs, creating a lumpy, useless mess.'

256
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,320
Is there a reason why you didn't use vanilla pods?

257
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,440
I've never used them before because none of my family bakes on this level and stuff.

258
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,200
You see it on TV, and they're either expensive or just...

259
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm used to vanilla extract, and this has got seeds in it so it has the look.

260
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,360
Are you a bit scared of the judges?

261
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,320
You want to make Mary proud and you want to prove what you can do.

262
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,920
- Is that what the relationship is? 
- That's what it is.

263
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,560
- So Mary is almost like your mum. 
- You want her to be proud of you.

264
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,200
- You want her to just...
- Yeah, yeah. 
- ..to not be disappointed.

265
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,560
Mary's disappointment is the worst thing, isn't it?

266
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,120
- Oh, yes. 
- Like a bucket of cold water.

267
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,920
31-year-old graphic designer, Ben,

268
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,840
was taught to bake by his grandmother,

269
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,600
but it's Mary he hopes to impress with his rhubarb and custard and "After Dinner" cupcakes.

270
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,800
I've got one lot done and ready to go.

271
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm just waiting to do the ganache on top of the mint ones

272
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,880
and I've probably got about 20 minutes to spare, hopefully.

273
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Lady bakers and gent bakers, you've got 15 minutes left.

274
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,800
I've never iced this fast before.

275
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm just making a butter cream, so I'll give it another little whizz

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and then start adding a huge amount of icing sugar to it.

277
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
And some booze.

278
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,760
'But alcohol is just the beginning of Simon's final presentation.'

279
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,080
- What is this?
- This is my cake stand. 
- So how does it work?

280
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,200
Each one just sits on its own lolly stick?

281
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,960
No, they get pierced - cut in the bottom and then pushed on.

282
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,920
The cupcakes will be iced and look like a bowl of flowers

283
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,680
and then I'll put rose leaves in between.

284
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,720
- Like that.
- Yes!
- I'm never going to live this down at the rugby club!

285
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,440
Rob, what gives? Oh, it's a dejected Rob!

286
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,800
- It is a dejected Rob. 
- No! Why a dejected Rob?

287
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,680
They didn't go right. These ones didn't rise, they just flopped out.

288
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,200
You're basically trimming off the excess round the sides.

289
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
They don't look anywhere near as good as I thought they would.

290
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,000
That's because you're a perfectionist. The beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder,

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,560
but also in the digestive tract of the beholder, so...

292
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
'Rob isn't the only baker facing presentation issues.'

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,960
I don't know how this is working.

294
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,760
'Urvashi was hoping to create piped chocolate chop sticks.'

295
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
It seems to be clogged up.

296
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,400
It might have been because I let the chocolate go too cold,

297
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,120
so I'm going to start again.

298
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,080
I think it is a little bit of the nerves playing up.

299
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,400
Normally, baking is my calm, relaxing, quiet time, distressing activity.

300
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,960
Not wanting to stress anyone out remotely,

301
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,720
but you do have ten minutes left, bakers.

302
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,320
Are you winning?

303
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,720
- Hope so.
- I'm fascinated now to see how it's going to turn out.

304
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
Some of these people are getting into too much technical detail, trying to get too many flavours in.

305
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,240
Simple is often the best way.

306
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,720
The moment those cakes come out of the oven, they're either all right or they're not,

307
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
and they've got to make the most of them. This is what happens in baking.

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh, look at that. Oh. Magnificent!

309
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,080
The problem is, the cupcake is not just the sponge,

310
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,960
but you can either mess it up or make it even more beautiful with the topping that you put on.

311
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,960
- Ah!
- Oh, hang on, hang on.

312
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,360
Got to love them.

313
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,280
OK, that's time up. Put away your piping bags.

314
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,440
Step away from the royal icing. It's judging time.

315
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,880
(Yes! Ah, ah, ah.)

316
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
These bakers are more accustomed to having their baking judged by their friends and family

317
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,040
than two of the country's leading professionals.

318
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,240
- Hello, Jo.
- Hi, there, hi.

319
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't they just look pretty?

320
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,400
We're always looking for this sort of, "gosh!" factor.

321
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,760
And that is just so inviting, isn't it?

322
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,360
- You'd be proud to put them in any shop to sell them.
- Thank you.

323
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
- There you are.
- Beautiful. 
- It does look good.

324
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,080
I made a drizzle with granulated sugar and some orange juice

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,280
so hopefully you should get a bit of that running through.

326
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,480
That is delicious. The orange lightens things up.

327
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
- Yeah.
- You've got two great bakes.

328
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,720
The topping, the flavours, the appearance, sublime.

329
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,400
- Oh, thank you so much. 
- It is very, very, very good.

330
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,240
I don't think I've ever heard him say that word on this show.

331
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,160
- And I'm about to take his temperature.
- Yes!

332
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,520
It's a mess.

333
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
- The meringue and the...? 
- And the apple, yeah.

334
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
It hasn't worked.

335
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
- The taste without the meringue is delicious.
- Thank you.

336
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,320
The apple and cinnamon just really beautifully balanced.

337
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,280
But what a shame that top didn't have a bit more of a finesse.

338
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,160
Lovely flavour, but then we come to the top.

339
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,360
Forgive me being rude, but it looks a bit like a stuffed olive.

340
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,960
Or an eyeball, perhaps.

341
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,040
I think this one, delicious. It's so fresh.

342
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,040
- It is.
- The fruit going through it really lifts it up.

343
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,640
I think, visually, they look amazing.

344
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,000
It's very doughy. It's sticking to the roof of my mouth.

345
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
This is a nice finish.

346
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,040
- I think they look stunning. 
- Your piping is perfect.

347
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,760
With a cupcake, so often there's so much on top.

348
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,440
All that icing, so sickly.

349
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,760
- There's nothing sickly about this at all.
- No.

350
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Now, that's rather clever. That's the raspberry jam in the middle.

351
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,680
A nice light sponge round the outside.

352
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,880
- It's delicious, absolutely delicious.
- Thank you.

353
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
- Different.
- It's a bouquet.

354
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,200
- It is.
- It's a bouquet of cupcakes. 
- Thought I'd give it a go.

355
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
I don't...

356
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,480
- ..I don't like it.
- I don't like it. It is quite heavy.

357
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,320
- Heavy flavour, not heavy texture. 
- OK, yeah.

358
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,440
Guinness, use one, chocolate, use another,

359
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,280
chocolate and Guinness, you're in a hiding for nothing.

360
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,240
- Think about your flavour combinations in future.
- OK. 
- (Just going to take this one...)

361
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,000
I think the banoffee pie is delicious.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
You've got lots of flavours going on.

363
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,800
A very clever idea to have the crumb crust.

364
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,960
It's sad, it's a bit of a disaster, really, isn't it?

365
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
- It is, yes, afraid so. 
- They went down in the middle when they were in the oven.

366
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,160
The flavour is not very distinctive, the lemon icing needs more lemon.

367
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,440
The taste of the lemon is very, very good.

368
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,400
Appearance-wise, too simple.

369
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,480
If you take all the fruit away

370
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,240
and leave one of those on their own.

371
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,400
Also, you must be able to eat the decoration,

372
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,720
- and I'm not sure whether you should eat orchids.
- No.

373
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,680
These should be boozy, shouldn't they? If I remember rightly.

374
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,960
They will probably be a bit boozy.

375
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,720
The liquorice very much comes through, and the Pernod.

376
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,080
It's a very unusual combination and, like Marmite,

377
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,160
- you'll either like it or loathe it. 
- I'm in the camp, I hate it.

378
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,520
- Paul hates it.
- I really...

379
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,240
I thought one of you would be in the camp.

380
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,840
- To be honest with you, it's disgusting.
- Paul!

381
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
It's sitting in my mouth. It's bitter on my tongue.

382
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,600
- The icing tastes OK, but you need to practise with your icing guide.
- Yeah.

383
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,000
I could've dropped that in from a five-foot height and ended up with that finish.

384
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,320
- Must try harder.
- Noted.

385
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,360
- I'm a fan of the Pernod, Rob. 
- Thanks.

386
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,440
Looks nice sponge inside, and light.

387
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,000
It's lovely and sharp and what goes better with rhubarb than cream?

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,280
Two great bakes, and the flavours are so delicate.

389
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,080
You've got lovely tart rhubarb, you've got the mint coming through, and it's very, very, very good.

390
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,640
Ben, Holly and Jo have already staked their claim to become this week's star baker.

391
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,920
But Rob, Janet and Simon must improve to avoid an early exit

392
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,720
from the Great British Bake Off.

393
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,760
I think it was a risk doing what I did, but it wouldn't have

394
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,400
been my baking, or my style of baking, if I'd played safe.

395
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm feeling a little bit more confident but, you know,

396
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
I don't want to get ahead of myself.

397
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,200
Their expectations are obviously higher than my friends' and my family!

398
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,120
After the individual flare of the signature bake,

399
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,560
the second challenge is a controlled technical bake,

400
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,200
allowing the judges to directly compare the bakers' ability.

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,240
Coming up now is possibly the moment that you've been dreading.

402
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
It's our first technical challenge of the series.

403
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,320
Now, this challenge is performed blind, which means we're going to ask the judges to leave.

404
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,120
Paul and Mary, you cannot see who is baking what.

405
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,440
The technical bake is a controlled test of both your intuition

406
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,480
and your ability.

407
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,120
You are going to be baking something you have no idea about,

408
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
and what you are going to be creating

409
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,560
is the bete noire of bakers -

410
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,000
it's a Battenberg cake.

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,120
Not just any old Battenberg cake, but a coffee and walnut Battenberg cake.

412
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,840
The judges are going to be looking for the perfect sponge

413
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,400
which holds its form, perfect symmetry, distinctive flavours

414
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,240
and also a very lovely smooth exterior.

415
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,840
And as if the pressure was not intense enough already, bakers,

416
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,600
you are going to be working to one of Mary Berry's -

417
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,960
that's Queen Mary Berry's - own recipes.

418
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,880
So, with that in mind, on your marks, get set, bake.

419
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,560
All the bakers have been given the same recipe.

420
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,520
It contains a full list of ingredients and measurements and a basic method.

421
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,720
Some details are missing and it's down to the bakers' instinct

422
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,320
and experience to deliver a Battenberg worthy of Mary Berry's classic interpretation.

423
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,560
OK, Mary, can I reveal...

424
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,160
- Come on.
- ..your gorgeous Battenberg?

425
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,560
- That looks lovely.
- Right, there it is, in all its glory

426
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,400
The history of this most famous of British cakes

427
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,160
began on the Isle of Wight in the 19th century

428
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,800
at Osborne House, the private residence of Queen Victoria.

429
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,640
Queen Victoria's favourite granddaughter, Princess Victoria,

430
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,000
fell in love with her first cousin once removed,

431
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,920
Prince Louis of Battenberg. They'd known each other since children.

432
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,800
As they grew older, they became increasingly devoted

433
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,560
to each other, and it was at Osborne House where the romance flourished.

434
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,760
When the engagement was announced, in early 1884,

435
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,280
the bakers of London decided to make a celebration cake

436
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,960
for the wedding, and it would be a Battenberg cake.

437
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,840
The Battenberg elevated British cake-making to new heights.

438
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,560
Layered with rich sponge, sugary jam and marzipan,

439
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,680
the cake was packed with flavour and sported a new design.

440
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,080
The most startling feature about Battenberg is always the colours,

441
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,880
and it was thought to be to reflect the romance of the wedding,

442
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,360
the pink, the pastel, the pale yellows. There were four squares,

443
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,440
each to honour one of the Battenberg princes -

444
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Prince Alexander, Prince Francis Joseph, Prince Henry

445
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,680
and, of course, Prince Louis.

446
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,320
It's most likely that, if this cake was created in London, it was created in Whitechapel.

447
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Most of the bakers in Whitechapel were German anyway,

448
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,880
so it's quite funny because we've taken the credit for this cake being a British cake,

449
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,560
but actually it was most likely created by a German baker for a German prince.

450
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,560
The Battenberg cake's link to the British monarchy is as strong today as when it was first created.

451
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,760
In 1947, our Queen Elizabeth II was married to her Prince Philip,

452
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,800
who just happens to be a direct descendant of the Battenberg family.

453
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,800
But can these 12 amateur bakers do justice to 125 years

454
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,080
of British baking history in just two hours?

455
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,280
I've never made a Battenberg before, no.

456
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,240
I have made a coffee and walnut cake before,

457
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,600
but I don't like coffee so I don't know how it was. It looked good.

458
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,000
I know what it is because Dot in EastEnders likes to make them for Jim.

459
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,800
The bakers have been given just one tin to bake both the vanilla

460
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,480
- and the coffee and walnut sponges. 
- I'm going to have to just hope.

461
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,920
It must be perfectly lined to bake two identical sponges simultaneously.

462
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,320
"Put the paper in half with the fold on the inner side.

463
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,880
"Open up the paper and push up the centre fold to make a 4cm pleat."

464
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,400
That's not going to work.

465
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,680
It's completely new territory for me. Not used to all this origami effort.

466
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,800
31-year-old Keith lives in Bedfordshire

467
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,440
and began baking after deciding to leave his job in the City to become

468
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,400
a full-time house husband and stay-at-home dad to his baby son, Alfie.

469
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,200
- Battenberg, Keith. Are you familiar?
- Nervous.

470
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,400
- Are you familiar?
- I haven't got a clue. I feel like Arsene Wenger!

471
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,680
It's like one game at a time, working my way through.

472
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Do you know why you shouldn't think like him?

473
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,240
You'll end up second or third in this contest! You won't win.

474
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,560
To create the basic Battenberg sponge,

475
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,120
the bakers have to combine butter, sugar, eggs and flour.

476
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,440
The tin was the most problematic, I think.

477
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,600
The cake should be OK.

478
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,120
Over-mixing will trap too much air in the mixture...

479
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,240
..air that will expand too much in the oven,

480
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,920
only to contract as it cools, causing the cake to sink,

481
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,840
making a symmetrical finish impossible.

482
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,800
Worried that it won't give me enough rise, but I'll see what happens.

483
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,400
To create the distinctive chequerboard design,

484
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,240
one half of the mixture must be coloured and flavoured with coffee.

485
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,320
I like experimenting and making my own recipes,

486
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,320
but I would much rather follow a Mary Berry recipe.

487
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,520
I'm good at following recipes, I think.

488
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,160
45-year-old Mary-Anne lives with her husband, Robert,

489
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,360
and daughter, Sasha, in Kidderminster.

490
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,920
She's represented Wales in women's rugby,

491
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,080
and has now brought all of her competitive spirit to baking.

492
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,480
I think I should go in search of more coffee.

493
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
It's not a very definite taste, so...

494
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,880
There's something very '70s about that taste.

495
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,280
It's a mild coffee flavour, which think that suits the Battenberg vibe.

496
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,440
- I shall let it sit and see if it develops a bit.
- OK.

497
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,120
- That was very cheffy, wasn't it? "Develops a bit."
- Exactly!

498
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,320
I put all the coffee in the cake instead of half in the cake and half for the icing, so I don't know.

499
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,760
It'll probably have a stronger flavour, but the judges wanted strong flavour

500
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,200
- so I'm sure they'll like it. 
- With weighing and mixing complete,

501
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,920
the bakers now need to plan how long their sponges need to bake for.

502
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,120
But also allow enough time for cooling and decoration.

503
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,360
I think having a military background does help to some extent,

504
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
following specific things to do.

505
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,880
It does make up for the fact that I'm a man, and multi-tasking is a nightmare.

506
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,680
I nearly had a stroke when I heard it was Battenberg.

507
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,120
I've always wanted to make a Battenberg,

508
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,200
and I thought what a good time to try!

509
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,320
So, under pressure while being filmed.

510
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,080
When he isn't baking, 40-year-old Ian works as a fund-raiser

511
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,960
for the Royal Academy of Arts.

512
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,920
He lives in Dunstable with his partner, Stefan, and their Cocker Spaniel, Monty.

513
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,040
He's been baking since he was a boy

514
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,600
when he realised that his mum couldn't.

515
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,800
- It's an anti-stress thing, this, isn't it?
- It is.
- I'll join you.

516
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,560
Even if I don't use them, I'm doing something with the time.

517
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,840
Do you feel the pressure's on because you're doing one of Mary's recipes?

518
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,240
Oh, God, yeah. You can't prepare. What would you do,

519
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,080
- go through every one of Mary's books and practise everything?
- No.

520
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,760
Please work.

521
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,160
As long as mine don't sink down... Yeah, boy!

522
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,800
- Otherwise I'm out of here.
- Little bit disappointed, actually.

523
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,000
My foil's curled over, so it's split away from the side.

524
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Hopefully I'll be able to rescue that with some marzipan.

525
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm actually quite happy with that.

526
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,560
It'll be fine.

527
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,800
I need to let the cakes chill. They have to be cold before I put this on.

528
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,560
The Battenbergs must be finished with a precisely measured amount of coffee butter cream.

529
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,920
Bingo jingo.

530
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,120
It bonds the four sponge sections together

531
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,760
and ensures that the marzipan stays stuck to the side of the cake.

532
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
- I don't like Battenberg. 
- Really? Why not?

533
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
- It's got marzipan on it. 
- Do you not like it?

534
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,960
I've never made one, I've never eaten one.

535
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,560
43-year-old housewife and WI member Yasmin lives in the Wirral

536
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,560
with her husband and three children. When she's not baking, she spends her time learning new hobbies,

537
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,240
including photography and burlesque dancing.

538
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,680
It's interesting that you're cooking something you don't like.

539
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,160
Maybe that's a good thing because it gives you a bit of distance from it.

540
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,200
You won't be emotionally tied up with it.

541
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,680
- I can be like one of my children and just pick the outside off.
- Yes!

542
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,520
OK, that's 15 minutes, everyone.

543
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,160
You should think about getting that marzipan on.

544
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,680
The Berry is coming.

545
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,360
It's going to be cut in two, into kind of long square shapes.

546
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,520
Not as perfect as I'd want them to be. That one's really not good.

547
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,760
You do one and one, and the alternate one, don't you?

548
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,680
It's quite difficult to get the butter cream on because the cake keeps crumbling.

549
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,640
It's a bit like brick-laying.

550
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm using cling-wrap here

551
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,000
- because I didn't want the marzipan to stick to the roller. 
- No, that didn't work.

552
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm using these two wooden handles to try

553
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,360
and get the marzipan an even width.

554
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,560
The moment of truth.

555
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,360
With some judicious encouragement, it can be persuaded to wrap round.

556
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,480
Rubbish.

557
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
Is it going to match?!

558
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
That'll be at the bottom, so they won't see that!

559
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,520
No, start again.

560
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,640
Stupid.

561
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm hoping that it's all going to stay together.

562
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,280
Much better.

563
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
OK! That's time up.

564
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,960
So if you'd like to bring your Battenberg booty here,

565
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,560
put it just behind the picture of yourself.

566
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,480
The judging for the technical bake is unique.

567
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,280
Paul and Mary will have no idea whose cake is whose.

568
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,120
Well...what an array of Battenbergs.

569
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,480
The strict rules of the technical bake are about to reveal

570
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
who has a future in the Bake Off and who will have

571
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,160
to up their game in the final challenge.

572
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,920
So, over to the first one.

573
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,080
- This is interesting.
- Well...

574
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,280
- Where's the butter cream?
- It seems to have disappeared at the end.

575
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,360
It didn't rise enough, and if it had risen just a little bit more,

576
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,120
- we would have a taller, squarer cake.
- It's flatter.

577
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,120
- You can't see what the Battenberg is.
- The whole idea of a Battenberg

578
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,400
- is to be able to see that chequerboard at the end.
- Oh, dear.

579
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,840
The marzipan is rather too thick.

580
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,000
- It's very yellow, this one, isn't it?
- It would be the egg yolks.

581
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,200
It's a good flavour. It's slightly drier than the others.

582
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,640
It is slightly drier. This is dinky.

583
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,680
And it's been really well pressed into shape.

584
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,880
- It looks very neat...
- It looks very pretty.
- ..and businesslike.

585
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,960
Now, this one is absolutely massive!

586
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,400
It's rather difficult to believe that you all had the same recipe.

587
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,560
Somebody's been beating very hard.

588
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,960
- There's hardly any butter cream at all.
- It's neat.

589
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
- There's butter cream in there. 
- This person has followed

590
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,720
the recipe exactly.

591
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,000
This one, again, has been totally encased.

592
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,920
This looks a very neat, tidy person, well trimmed.

593
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,600
This is another rectangular one.

594
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,240
No butter cream round the outside again.

595
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,000
As you can see here, it's a generous amount.

596
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,920
It's sticking the squares together, but none left for the outside.

597
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,720
It's very strong coffee.

598
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
It's very strong coffee. Marzipan's very neat.

599
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,120
This has been well trimmed. It looks perfection.

600
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,560
- It's good flavour, good bake. 
- A very good execution.

601
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,480
And finally, the last one.

602
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,560
It's a little uneven,

603
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,000
the marzipan round the outside, but it is beautifully thin.

604
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,720
- Now we have to decide.
- We do.

605
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,880
Paul and Mary must now rank all of the Battenbergs

606
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,520
from the worst to the best.

607
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,960
The bakers' position in this challenge could prove crucial

608
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,360
to their chance of staying in the competition.

609
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Our decision has been made, and in 12th place

610
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,960
is this one. Whose is this?

611
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,000
It needed cutting into a square, not a rectangle,

612
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,800
needed a lot more butter cream on the inside.

613
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,720
And the next one is...

614
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,000
It's me, unfortunately.

615
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,160
Rather too much marzipan.

616
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,880
10th place is this one.

617
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,160
- Whose is that? 
- And who is this one here?

618
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,360
Marzipan is not stuck down at all.

619
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,560
- In fact, it's flying in the wind. 
- And in 8th place is this person.

620
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,000
Janet, it needed more butter cream round the outside.

621
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
Again, it's rectangular and we wanted it square.

622
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Urvashi, Jason, Yasmin and Mary-Anne have all done enough

623
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,560
to keep themselves out of danger.

624
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,760
Now we're coming to the proper shaped ones.

625
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,800
This one has achieved the right shape,

626
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,040
and it certainly had the right flavour. Well done.

627
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Number two is this one. Well done.

628
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,360
And who has this one here?

629
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,640
- This is a masterpiece. 
- Well done, Holly. 
- APPLAUSE

630
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm feeling very smiley, tired but very, very smiley and happy,

631
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,480
and relieved.

632
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm feeling elated, compared to last time.

633
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,760
Top three, I didn't even think I'd do that, but brilliant.

634
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,920
- So buzzing.
- I'm still quite optimistic, you know.

635
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,320
I still feel that, you know, not all is lost.

636
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,960
Tomorrow, my biggest focus, I think, is going to be praying

637
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,840
that Lady Luck's on my side and that something goes well for me.

638
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,800
I might even be relying on a bit luck that something went bad for someone else.

639
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,240
Just one more challenge remains in this week's Bake Off,

640
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,120
a final chance for the bakers to convince Paul and Mary

641
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
that they have what it takes to remain in the competition.

642
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,720
I thought Holly really did wonders.

643
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,360
She was top of the class, both times.

644
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,720
Joanne, her cupcakes were so professional.

645
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,120
She then fell flat on her face with the Battenberg.

646
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,200
- She had a terrible one, didn't she? 
- Keith didn't do very well.

647
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,720
He came bottom in the Battenberg and he wasn't too good in the cupcakes.

648
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,040
Janet didn't impress you with the cupcakes.

649
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,640
- They weren't done, they sunk. 
- She's already said to us big cakes are her forte.

650
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,000
And also Rob, with the liquorice cupcakes.

651
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,040
- The liquorice didn't work.
- It didn't go down very well with either of you.
- No.

652
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,160
Then on the Battenberg he was in the top quarter!

653
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,560
- He did well, but that showed his skill.
- Simon's Guinness thing didn't work on any level,

654
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,720
and he was also in the bottom third of the Battenbergs.

655
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,960
It'll be interesting to see who raises their game and who buckles.

656
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Good morning, bakers.

657
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,000
Now, we have the Showstopper Challenge -

658
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,200
jazz hands are not mandatory - where you're going to be creating a tiered celebration cake.

659
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,760
The judges are looking for brilliant ideas,

660
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,720
elaborate multi-layered designs and, most important of all,

661
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,840
it's got to taste as good as it looks.

662
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,120
- So, what for one of you will be final time, on your marks, get set.
- Bake!

663
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,640
The Showstopper Challenge is the ultimate test

664
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,080
of ingenuity and creativity under immense time pressure.

665
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Not only have they got to make two or three cakes baked to perfection...

666
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,840
..they've got to go beyond anything they've done before.

667
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,960
They've got to decorate it, a sugar paste, a fondant, a ganache.

668
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,880
We're looking for a really high standard.

669
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,000
Then they've got to think of the finesse,

670
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,480
the little bits to make that cake go, "Wow, that is amazing."

671
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,600
The cakes must be baked, cooled, stacked and fully decorated

672
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
in just five hours.

673
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,640
Today's more of a fun day for me.

674
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,880
I've done the cake a lot of times, I enjoy working with chocolate.

675
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,200
I'll be more relaxed, should be a different me!

676
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,440
Rob needs to impress with his two-tiered chocolate showstopper,

677
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,240
filled with fresh chocolate mousse, covered in a dark chocolate ganache,

678
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,200
and finished with a cracked tempered chocolate decoration.

679
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,360
'I'm doing a Genoise sponge and you add butter in the end.'

680
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,840
'A Genoise is a technically daunting variation on a standard sponge cake

681
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,520
'that forms the basis for most French patisserie.

682
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,640
'It contains no raising agents and the cake gets its rise and unique

683
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,520
'texture through heating the eggs and sugar over a moderate heat

684
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,600
'and then whisking them until enough air has been trapped to triple the batter's volume.

685
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,480
'This then has to be slowly folded into flour.'

686
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm worried about the chocolate,

687
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,720
- I don't know how it will turn out, but...
- I'm worried that bowl isn't big enough.

688
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,000
- Yeah, I've never done with this amount of mixture before. 
- Yeah, I guessed, I guessed.

689
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
'All the bakers have to produce at least two perfectly baked sponges.

690
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,360
'Mary-Anne has set herself an even tougher challenge.'

691
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:40,720
It's a cake of many layers. Rather than bake one big cake and then slice it into layers,

692
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm making very thin layers and assembling them into a cake.

693
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,960
She's attempting an Opera cake, which is traditionally square and

694
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,040
features at least five extremely thin layers of sponge, filling and icing.

695
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,160
So how many layers are we talking about, in total?

696
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,120
Four sponge, two buttercream, that's six, a ganache...

697
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,560
- Seven.
- ..And the mirror glaze, eight.

698
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,880
- Wowzers!
- This really is difficult!

699
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,440
To think that this is the very first programme

700
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,520
- and we're getting this very exciting cake.
- I hope I'm not peaking too early.

701
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,640
'Simon is hoping to book his place in the next round by dazzling with what's inside his cake.'

702
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,720
I hope it'll be enough to impress them. It's usually better the third day,

703
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,040
but, from experience, these cakes never last three days anyway.

704
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,400
He's recreating his mum's recipe for courgette and chocolate cake

705
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,400
and topping it with fresh fruit and vanilla buttercream icing.

706
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,880
The courgettes go in here, similar to what you do in a carrot cake.

707
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,400
It adds moisture without an overpowering flavour.

708
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,680
Yeah, I thought it was strange when my mum gave me the recipe a few years ago, but it works well.

709
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,360
'Most of the bakers have chosen chocolate as a key ingredient in their tiered showstopper cakes,

710
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,960
'and some are attempting to use it in its elusive tempered form.'

711
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,600
I think it makes it stronger but I don't do chocolate very often, so I'm hoping it works.

712
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,720
'Tempering is a process that must be done in advance

713
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,480
'and aims to produce perfect crystallisation in melted chocolate.'

714
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,000
It is quite a skilled thing to do. I've managed it successfully a few times.

715
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,760
I hope today will be one of them.

716
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,800
'The fats in cocoa butter can crystallise in six different forms.

717
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,000
'Just one, the so-called seed crystal,

718
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,480
'results in the shiny flexible chocolate that can be used for

719
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,160
'decorations and collars to wrap around cakes.'

720
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,520
Don't know the intricacies of these things.

721
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,200
'To create seed crystals,

722
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,640
'chocolate must be heated over water to exactly 45 Celsius.'

723
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,200
At home, I just shove it in the microwave, you know.

724
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,240
'Then it must be cooled to 27 Celsius whilst stirring continuously.'

725
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,800
How can you wait to eat it?

726
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,880
'Finally, it must be manipulated as it cools on a flat surface.'

727
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,280
- I think it's going to be OK. 
- 'Only this process will provide a glossy finish and crisp texture.'

728
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,440
You can leave that to set and then get a knife and cut through the plastic,

729
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,800
so you end up with strips of chocolate on plastic.

730
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,560
- You can then pick up that chocolate, and the plastic... 
- Is this the first...?

731
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,720
..wrap it round a cake and take the plastic off.

732
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,600
The chocolate adheres to the cake and gives you a smooth finish.

733
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Only Jo is attempting to go one better.

734
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,520
Actually, it's better than I hoped for.

735
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,440
She's attempting a polka dot white and milk chocolate collar

736
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,200
for her two-tiered chocolate and fresh strawberry cake.

737
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,240
I've got a ribbon and things I want to put round it and a brooch.

738
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,200
I wanted to keep it quite simple, but famous last words.

739
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,440
'Three hours to go in the final challenge.'

740
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,680
Well, we've all seen how tough it is baking for the judges.

741
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,200
But imagine if you were asked to bake a cake for the Prime Minister.

742
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,520
Sir Winston Churchill: 'We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

743
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,760
'We shall fight in the hills.

744
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,320
- 'We shall never surrender!' 
- Our great wartime leader, Winston Churchill,

745
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,360
sending out a stern warning to any country that dared pick a fight with us.

746
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,120
What you might not know is that Winston Churchill himself was the cause of a great conflict here,

747
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,800
on British soil - The Battle of the Cake Bakers.

748
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,520
Churchill's status as Prime Minister made every birthday a national event.

749
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,320
He'd receive thousands of telegrams and cards.

750
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,920
Downing Street would be packed with well-wishers and, year after year,

751
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,240
the country's best bakers would fight for the right to bake Churchill's cake.

752
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,440
Now, there are only a handful of people left who've had

753
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,880
the honour of baking this prized cake, but I found one of them in Essex,

754
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,400
in the heart of Winston Churchill's old constituency.

755
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,840
84 year-old Mike Tomkins was just 26

756
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,680
when he was selected to bake our wartime leader's 80th birthday cake.

757
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,280
The family bakery in South Woodford is now run by son, Chris,

758
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,760
and is still going strong.

759
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,400
So you got the call to make the cake.

760
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,800
Yes, one of the shop girls passed the message on, and I just didn't believe it.

761
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,520
So I had to return the call, and then I found out it was real.

762
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,080
- You thought it was somebody winding you up.
- Yes, that's right.

763
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,080
I then had to think very hard about what sort of cake I would make Winston Churchill.

764
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,000
To me, it became an obvious solution to have an octagonal cake,

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,160
eight sides, to demonstrate achievements that Churchill had made in his 80 years.

766
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,200
And what are these different designs showing?

767
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,560
- There's his hat and cigar. 
- The trademark.

768
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,480
And, of course, his famous V-sign.

769
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
What's this over here, Mike? There's a trowel.

770
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,320
- Oh, yes, he was a bricklayer as well, in his garden.
- Really?

771
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,360
Oh, yes, he was a competent bricklayer

772
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,800
- So a lot of work creating these designs.
- A lot of work, yes.

773
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,560
- What an achievement.
- Well, I felt proud to have been given the chance to do it,

774
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,440
because he is the man of the century without a doubt.

775
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Mike's cake recipe is as traditionally British as Churchill himself.

776
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,640
Laced with treacle, spices and dried fruit,

777
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,480
soaked in Winston's favourite tipple.

778
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,080
- Shall we add a bit more whisky, Mike?
- Just a little.

779
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,200
- A little? How much, Mike?
- Go on, I'll tell you.
- OK.

780
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,120
Oh, hello. More than that?

781
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,760
- Now, enough. 
- SHE LAUGHS

782
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,200
Do you need any help with that bit, Chris?

783
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,040
- Do you need me to...?
- Well, as long as no fingers go in it.

784
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,920
I'm very excited.

785
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,720
Mike personally delivered the original cake to Churchill on his 80th birthday,

786
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,520
so this reproduction is a true slice of history.

787
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,960
- That's absolutely gorgeous.
- Mm.

788
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,080
Is this bringing back memories?

789
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,320
Oh, it's unbelievable when you look back on it all.

790
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,040
I've always said, it's my only claim to fame. Peak of my life.

791
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
No question.

792
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,440
Here's to Winston himself.

793
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,000
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

794
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,520
- There's enough booze in there to have a toast, isn't there?
- Yes.

795
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,120
- Mm.
- Ooh.

796
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,080
Yeah, I'm very happy with that one, yeah.

797
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:54,040
I'm hoping that's not liquid something inside. Nothing I can do now. Point of no return!

798
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,480
Janet's future in the Bake Off could rest on her two-tiered dark chocolate marble cake,

799
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,080
topped with handmade chocolate truffles.

800
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,880
- How did you make these? 
- Just a usual sponge, sort of thing.

801
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,560
Then knifed in 200 grams of melted dark chocolate.

802
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,760
That's very effective. It's come out really well.

803
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,360
'While their sponges are cooling, most of the bakers have

804
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,000
'moved on to preparing their toppings and fillings.'

805
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,760
- I'm in my element, kneading sugar paste. It's brilliant. I love it. 
- Good lad.
- It's therapeutic.

806
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,000
I feel like I'm back at home.

807
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Keith is creating a two-tiered chocolate cake,

808
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,280
inspired by his son Alfie's favourite television programme.

809
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,320
- A lighter green goes on the base, which is, if you like, the land.
- Mm.

810
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,920
Slightly darker green at the top, tunnel inside, trains coming through the tunnels.

811
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,960
Are you going to have a tunnel, a real tunnel?

812
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,320
Well, not a real, real tunnel, but...

813
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,800
- But a tunnel of cake.
- Yeah.

814
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,680
Yeah.

815
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,680
OK, bakers, just 30 minutes left.

816
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,280
Just time to smear that last blob of ganache on.

817
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,800
I'm just layering up with the chocolate butter cream,

818
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,320
and ganache, and then I'm going to trim it so that it looks stunning instead of like a dog's breakfast.

819
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,200
This is about as complicated as I wanted to get. I didn't want to go throwing in,

820
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,480
having to temper chocolate and do flowers and stuff.

821
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,520
It's not worked.

822
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,440
Get my hands washed.

823
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,160
The chocolate didn't set properly so I had to rescue it and put a panel on it,

824
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,520
so I'm going to try and work panels round the whole outside,

825
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,720
just to give it... I like that sheen better.

826
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,800
I can only do what I can do in the time I've got, so we'll see what happens.

827
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,640
Ben aims to produce the tallest cake in the final challenge,

828
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,640
a three-tiered vanilla sponge cake covered in air-brushed sugar paste icing.

829
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,000
I'm trying to get it on and done and.

830
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,120
You're the make-up artist to all the sponge cakes. When they need perfection they call for you.

831
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,720
'Before they can finish their final decorations, the bakers have to face stacking their tiers.'

832
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
They're ordinary drinking straws, but they're quite good for this.

833
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,360
'A process that even professionals fear.'

834
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,280
They give you a bit of support for the top tiers to sit on.

835
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,400
'Straws or dowling must be used to create a foundation for each tier.'

836
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,480
This is a bit of butter cream. It just sticks them together to stop them sliding around.

837
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
It should stay neatly on top.

838
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,760
OK, bakers, 15 minutes.

839
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,200
My hands are shaking. Phew!

840
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,440
Yahhh!

841
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,080
THUD Ohh!

842
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,120
BLEEP.

843
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,400
OK... Oh, man, I'm sorry.

844
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Is there anything we can do then?

845
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,120
I think as I was turning it round I kept pushing it a bit,

846
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,320
turning it round, pushing it a bit more, and just pushed it off.

847
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,840
I'm so gutted. So gutted.

848
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,960
I thought it was starting to look really good, as well.

849
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,440
You didn't mean it to happen.

850
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,920
Try and rescue one of those layers.

851
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,520
Hang on. Don't, don't bend it, right?

852
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,560
Hang on. Get your hand there.

853
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,600
Now, you've got one layer, put a layer of chocolate on that now.

854
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,880
A layer of chocolate on it, get it round the side, now.

855
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,920
Poor Rob.

856
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,800
Ladies and gentlemen, it's that time of day, the time for stopping and moving away.

857
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,880
Thankfully, everything went on pretty much as I'd like it to.

858
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,640
We got the colour on there, we got everything on, so,

859
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,240
fingers crossed, it'll taste as good as it looks.

860
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,360
It looks OK from a distance.

861
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,400
If you don't look too close, it looks quite castle-like,

862
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,720
Transylvania castle-like!

863
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,080
I ran out of time and didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted, but it's finished,

864
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,680
I suppose, so I'm happy.

865
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,520
If somebody said to me, "Do you think you're going to be in the competition from now?"

866
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,920
I'd say, "Probably not", actually, because I did abysmally yesterday.

867
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,960
It's a bit of a Pyrrhic victory if I was to beat Rob to the post.

868
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,880
It's like racing against a guy with a broken leg. It's not fair, is it?

869
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,760
For one of these bakers, this will be the last time that they face the judges.

870
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:11,840
Mary and Paul will taste each cake individually before discussing their final decision away from the bakers.

871
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,320
The brief was, a tiered celebration cake.

872
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,960
What we have here is two layered cakes.

873
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,640
It tastes absolutely divine.

874
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,480
- If I was being very picky I would like to have seen a tempered chocolate somewhere.
- Mm-hm.

875
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,440
..Because that's what you need on an Opera, to go crack and then down.

876
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,000
But that is a very good cake.

877
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
- Thank you.
- It tastes delicious. 
- Thank you.

878
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,360
I've made and tried lots of courgette cakes,

879
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,360
but this one is quite different and it's very chocolatey.

880
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,600
The icing on it, it needs work, it needs to be smoother,

881
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,120
- and it needs to be set.
- Mm-hm.

882
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,160
I'm not too keen on these because I feel that I would like to have made something.

883
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,720
- Don't buy things to cover up your own mistakes, essentially.
- Yeah.

884
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,800
Mm... There's booze.

885
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,920
Yes.

886
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,640
On the base. Too much?

887
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,480
- Oh, yes, lovely.
- That's fine.

888
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,960
You've had difficulty with the outside.

889
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,080
The interior is fantastic.

890
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,600
It is, in fact, a beautifully baked sponge.

891
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,800
The overall appearance of it, it needs work.

892
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,720
Personally, I would have liked to have seen these being constructed by you.

893
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,720
The actual icing is very good, you've rolled that well.

894
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,760
- It's slightly under-baked. 
- It looks...

895
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,400
Mm... It's dropped. It probably needed another five minutes.

896
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,160
Just look at that. It's beautifully marbled.

897
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,640
- I'm scared if it's OK. 
- You've got a chocolate butter cream running through it too.

898
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,080
- I have, yeah.
- That's delicious.

899
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,320
The chocolate that's coming through, it's not bitter at all. It's lovely and sweet.

900
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,800
The dark chocolate ganache is very good.

901
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,480
I think the cow's fantastic.

902
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,800
You've got a lovely smooth edge here, too.

903
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,640
Overall, the appearance is very unmistakeable.

904
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,200
But the sponge is a little bland.

905
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,320
I think it's slightly overdone, as well.

906
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,400
- I think more work on the sponge and a little less time on the finish. 
- Yes.

907
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,960
- This was a Genoise.
- Yeah.

908
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,800
- And do you know...
- The truffles add to it.
- Exactly.

909
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,480
We haven't had one in the bake off before. It's very tricky.

910
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,160
The taste of that - it's a shame you haven't got the top, to be honest.

911
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,400
The taste of that is divine.

912
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,520
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

913
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,200
Paul and Mary must now decide who is this week's star baker

914
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,600
and who hasn't done enough to stay in the competition.

915
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,480
Who's really impressed you? Who's your star baker?

916
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,720
I think it's Holly and Jo.

917
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,240
Holly came top in both of the challenges.

918
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,680
She showed her skills, she thought out her recipes, she could go far.

919
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,440
And today, her novelty cake was a little bit awkward.

920
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Jo's sponge today is stunning. But then, on the Battenberg, it all went to pieces.

921
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,080
- So overall?
- I think it's one of those two girls.

922
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,960
Who is looking as if they might be going today?

923
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,640
- I can think of three boys. 
- Three boys?

924
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,440
Rob, I wasn't too pleased.

925
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,160
He lost one of the tiers on his cake!

926
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,280
But he was the one that did the Genoise, the most difficult sponge to make.

927
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,520
Keith and Simon are also in a very precarious position.

928
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,880
When you look at Keith, his celebration cake was too simple.

929
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,720
And Simon did the Guinness cake and it really didn't taste very nice.

930
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,280
Well, I've got someone in mind.

931
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,120
I have, too.

932
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,360
- Oh, my heart just started going then. 
- It's not you, Mel.

933
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,280
- It's not you.
- Sorry. 
- You're not scheduled to go till next week.
- OK.

934
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,720
Bakers, first things first. We want to thank you for all your hard work.

935
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,000
It's been an incredibly tiring weekend, but you have really surpassed yourselves.

936
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,120
Paul and Mary want you to know the standard's been incredibly high.

937
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,280
With that in mind, each week we'll nominate a star baker.

938
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,800
And the person this week who has that accolade is...

939
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,200
Holly. Well done, Holly.

940
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,680
But I'm afraid there is one person among you who hasn't impressed the judges quite enough

941
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,120
to stay with us on the Bake Off.

942
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,320
I'm sorry to say that the person who will not be joining us next week...

943
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,160
is Keith.

944
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,480
Commiserations, Keith. Round of applause.

945
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,320
- Well done.
- Thank you very much, I've had a great time.

946
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,680
'I suppose the only part of me that's sad about leaving today is'

947
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,160
cos I don't want to be the first one who goes, but someone has to be and, you know, it was my time.

948
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,000
It's the way it goes sometimes, isn't it?

949
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,480
'I'm looking forward to getting back to home baking and doing things that I do week in, week out,'

950
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,760
baking breads and pies and, yeah, no more cakes.

951
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,560
- Relieved!
- OMG!

952
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:19,920
'I'm massively relieved I'm here, just because it was such an uncertain week for me, and so I feel relieved'

953
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,600
that I've got through so that I can show how good I am at other things.

954
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,160
I feel quite pleased, I'm trying to stop myself smiling because I think it can...

955
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,400
I don't want to look smug cos I'm well aware that next week I could be going.

956
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,760
- Are you proud?
- I am, yeah.

957
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,200
'It's lovely to get positive feedback from people, particularly Mary.

958
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,240
'I've been baking her cakes for a long time.'

959
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,560
I don't want to disappoint her now! So I want to keep doing well.

960
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,280
PHONE RINGS

961
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,720
Hello, I've just finished.

962
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,160
And...I'm through to the pastry!

963
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,760
Next time...

964
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,880
- Did you sleep last night? 
- I didn't, no.

965
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,880
- 'The bakers tackle tarts.'
- My biggest concern is that my pastry will have a soggy bottom.

966
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,240
Creating their signature quiches.

967
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,120
- It looks a mess.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- OK.

968
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,800
Mary Berry's second technical challenge.

969
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,880
Very nice short pastry.

970
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,000
- 'Tarte au citron.'
- It's shrinking away from the side.

971
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,560
And 24 show-stopping miniature sweet tarts.

972
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,040
Just get it done. Stop messing around and get it in the oven.

973
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,480
But who will become the next star baker?

974
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,680
You can win it one week and be knocked out the next.

975
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,280
And whose Bake Off is about to end?

976
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,000
- Nobody gets an extra chance.
- Her work is just a little bit clumsy.

977
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,480
Oh, no!

978
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,640
The person who will be leaving us this week is...

979
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,160
Oh, sorry!

980
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,320
