1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
It's week six and we feel like Snow White because there are seven bakers

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,640
- about to beaver away in that tent. 
- We've got Flaky, Bakey,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,840
Little-bit-shaky, Achy, Cakey, Awful-lot-at-stakey.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,080
- And...
- And Andrew.
- Welcome to...

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
- BOTH:
- The Great British Bake Off.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
Last time, it was pastry...

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,280
That was meant to happen.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,680
I've only got 11 in there.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,200
That's left over.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,560
Oh, my word! The oven wasn't on.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,760
..and, after getting herself into a fine filo mess...

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
This is why life is too short to make filo pastry. Buy it.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,680
This really does look more like shortcrust pastry

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,200
than filo, I'm afraid.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,600
..it was Val who was sent home.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
I wasn't surprised, I reached my limit.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,240
Despite Rav's miraculous comeback...

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,920
Beautifully proportioned, lovely and crispy.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,640
..and Jane's best efforts...

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
- They taste amazing. 
- It's absolutely delicious.

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,040
..it was Candice's pair of perfect amuse-bouche...

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,560
- Ten out of ten. 
- Thank you very much.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,120
..that earned her Star Baker for the second time.

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,840
Now, for the first time ever,

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,640
Bake Off is turning to nature in Botanical week.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,080
A citrus meringue...

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,400
Mine is so wet.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,520
..with a twist.

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,800
Looks horrendous.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
A leafy bread Technical...

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,920
I've never been so stressed about dough in my life.

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,640
..and a blooming three-tiered Showstopper.

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,920
This is a complete mess.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I don't do pretty with my bakes.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
This is my week, because it's Botanical week.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
It could almost have been made for me. Because I'm a gardener!

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,800
And it will be crushing if I actually fail.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800
It's one of those things where you kind of have to be a neat baker

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,720
and I'm not the neatest of bakers, so we'll see how things go today.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,880
Botanical week, for me, I think, means things that are aromatic.

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,760
It's not just about plants. Anything that grows goes.

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Good morning, bakers.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,880
Congratulations for making it thus far, all the way to Botanicals week.

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,960
So this morning Paul and Mary would love you to make a very large

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,480
citrus meringue pie big enough for us all to tuck in to.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,280
Now, this impressive pie should have perfect pastry,

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,960
melt in the mouth meringue, and a citrusy filling.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,200
You have two hours on this challenge.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
- On your marks.
- Get set. 
- BOTH:
- Bake!

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,080
Not feeling nervous about this challenge.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,160
I do like making meringue. I make it quite a bit.

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,360
It's quite a humid day today, so we don't want it, like, deflating.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
We want it nice and stiff.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
Do you like my Botanical week top?

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Once every few years, this flower shirt comes out. This is the moment.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,480
Citrus meringue pie is something that, to me, is sheer heaven.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
Oranges, limes, lemons, grapefruit.

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
They can use any of those flavours.

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,360
I would like the meringue to be crisp.

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,160
For me, the perfect way is to have it in the oven,

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,040
you just set the top firm.

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,280
It's about balancing sweetness in the meringue down

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,800
with the sharpness from the actual curd -

64
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,360
and carried in a beautifully crisp base.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,520
We're all familiar with a lemon meringue pie,

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,560
but this challenge is a step up.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,640
The bakers can use anything that grows

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,880
to put their twist on this classic.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,760
I've added some mandarin zest into the pastry

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,120
because I'm having a mandarin curd for my citrus meringue pie.

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,640
There's also going to be some tequila in there, as well!

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Most of the bakers are making a sweet shortcrust pastry.

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,480
Some are even adding extra ingredients

74
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,200
for maximum botanical taste.

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,360
I just put some coconut flavouring in.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,240
So, this is stem ginger, and I'm putting it in my base.

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Sweet shortcrust pastry is made by rubbing together flour and butter

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
until it resembles breadcrumbs,

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,840
then adding eggs or water to bring the mixture together,

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,040
and sugar for sweetness.

81
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,480
Tom is trying something a little different.

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Not making a sweet pastry

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,960
because I'm not a big fan of sweet pastry myself.

84
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,360
So I've used pecans to give it

85
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
an extra bit of savoury aromatic sweetness.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
The dough is then left to chill before rolling out.

87
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,920
It rests, so the gluten relaxes, so it's not tough.

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,280
You want it to be nice and short and crumbly.

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,520
- Morning, Selasi.
- Morning. 
- I love the botanical shirt.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
- Thank you very much.
- It's great.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Tell us about your citrus Meringue.

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm making a grapefruit, orange and mint meringue pie.

93
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,240
And French meringue on top.

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Selasi is using a combination of red grapefruit and orange flavours

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,000
to achieve the perfect sharpness for his curd.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,720
And he'll then decorate with fresh fruit on top of his French meringue.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,440
- How are you going to put that meringue on?
- I'm piping it on top.

98
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm making sort of sharp edged kisses on top.

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
- Sorry?
- Haven't you ever had a sharp edged kiss?
- What?

100
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
Like a meringue kiss.

101
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm adding a bit of physalis.

102
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,200
Not to say syphilis.

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,240
- I call it phy-salis. 
- What do you say, Bez?

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,360
- Cape gooseberries. 
- Cape gooseberries?

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Don't give too many sharp edged kisses, cos you will get physalis.

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
HE LAUGHS

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
Mary liked my shirt. I kind of like her top, actually, it's quite nice.

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,600
Paul should have worn a floral shirt.

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Like one of those salsa dancer shirts.

110
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

111
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Selasi's not the only baker using grapefruit.

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Funny enough, I used to really hate grapefruit -

113
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,720
then I actually had a grapefruit meringue pie, without the ginger,

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,840
and it was, like, really, really good. I think that converted me.

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,760
Benjamina's adding ginger to spice up her pink,

116
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,600
red and white grapefruit curd, topped with an Italian meringue.

117
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,080
The meringue on the top, how are you going to be piping that?

118
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,560
- Are you going to be dumping it?
- No dumping, I'm going to pipe it nicely

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,080
with a nice nozzle, like little roses.

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,200
And then give it a good old blowtorch.

121
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I can't believe you thought Benjamina would DUMP meringue, Paul.

122
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
- She's not a dumper. 
- She's not a dumper.

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,880
- But good luck, Benjamina. 
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,600
My mum used to make a killer key lime pie. And I always remember

125
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,560
the flavour from that. I enjoy a good citrus tang.

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,360
Andrew's take on his mum's killer key lime pie

127
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,720
will use the juice and zest of four limes

128
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,960
and three different types of ginger,

129
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,640
finished with piped Italian meringue.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
More ginger. Love the ginger.

131
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,760
This one's going to go into my curd.

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
Think it's time to roll.

133
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,960
The perfect pastry must be rolled out thin enough

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,400
so that it forms a light and crispy base...

135
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,000
..but not so thin that it runs the risk of the curd leaking.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,280
I like a relatively thick pastry.

137
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,480
This has got quite a substantial filling in it.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,000
- Approximately as thick as Selasi's, my pastry will be.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,160
All of the bakers are blind baking their pastry.

140
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,360
This ensures the base is evenly baked,

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
giving them time to tackle their fillings.

142
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,440
15 minutes that's going to blind bake for.

143
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,560
- Good morning, Rav.
- Good morning, guys.
- Morning, Ravvers.

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,040
Now, your pastry's still on there, not even in the oven yet.

145
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,440
It is, it's going into the oven in less than a couple of minutes.

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,480
Rav's flavoured his pastry with mandarin.

147
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,600
It's filled with a tequila and mandarin curd,

148
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
and he'll serve his finished pie

149
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
with mandarin margaritas on the side.

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Tequila's going to be fascinating, to see how that comes through.

151
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,840
- And on the top?
- On the top I'm going to be making an Italian Meringue.

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
How are you going to be displaying that?

153
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm just going to be using a spatula to make some waving pattern,

154
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,640
- then I'm going to be blowtorching. 
- You're only blowtorching it?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,280
So, I'm making a blood orange pumpkin Halloween pie.

156
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,280
And it's inspired by my friend's Thanksgiving pumpkin pie.

157
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Tom's pie will be covered by a smooth dome of pecan meringue,

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
and finished with a drizzle of blood orange syrup.

159
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,720
Pumpkins can be very, very sweet,

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
and actually quite a botanical sweetness.

161
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,760
It's not like, sugar sweet -

162
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,920
that's going to come from the meringue.

163
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,800
- So, who's copied who?
- Well, I mean, it was my idea. Doing grapefruit.

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,640
- What do you think he's been doing? Reading your e-mails?
- I think so.

165
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,000
- Do you think he's outside your house?
- He's hacked into my...

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,880
- Night-vision...
- ..into my laptop. 
- Night-vision goggles?
- I think so.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,680
Jane and Candice are also going head-to-head

168
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,600
with their botanical flavours.

169
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,520
I'm cooking a lime and coconut meringue pie.

170
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
And the inspiration really comes from Harry Nilsson's song

171
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,440
called Coconut. My husband, when I met him,

172
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
it would be one of those things,

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
if you talk about lime or about coconut, we both go into

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,640
"put the lime in the coconut," so it just seemed an obvious choice.

175
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
Jane's striving for top spot by putting the lime in the filling,

176
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
and the coconut in the pastry,

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,200
and she'll finish with a coconut meringue.

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,960
- You're using Italian meringue or conventional?
- I'm doing Swiss.

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,640
- It's a Swiss one.
- Oh, right. 
- It just crisps nicely in the oven.

180
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,640
- Which I like them in the oven. 
- Well, good luck anyway, Jane.

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,720
Thank you.

182
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
Swiss meringue's quite stable,

183
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
and I wanted to then bake mine so it was crispy,

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
and Swiss meringue you can do that with.

185
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,240
Mine's got to be good to beat Candice.

186
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,520
I know where my rival is. She's right behind me today.

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,720
So, my bake is my lime and coconut meringue pie.

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm using a little bit of... I've got some lemon grass and some sugar,

189
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
so hopefully it just gives it a sort of a real, sort of, background

190
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,000
that kind of goes together.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,280
Candice is making sweet vanilla pastry

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,440
filled with a lime and lemon grass curd.

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,760
Her coconut meringue will be piped with a decorative twist.

194
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm going to strip my piping bag with some green,

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,080
so you've got sort of a green swirl going through some of the roses.

196
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,520
It's a nice look, when you paint the inside of your bag and then pipe it.

197
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,400
- How are you finishing the meringue, In the oven?
- Yeah, going to finish

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,200
it in the oven. I have got a blowtorch. If there's not enough

199
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,080
colour on the white bits I might do, but I'm happy with the oven bake.

200
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
- Thank you, Candice.
- Thank you.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,520
The thing that I'm not too happy about

202
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,200
is they're nearly all using blowtorches. And, to me,

203
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,640
meringue topping is best

204
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,400
put in the oven to get a crunchiness.

205
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,360
And not many of them have got that method.

206
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,280
I want that slight crack, you just drop your fork in there.

207
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,080
- It's delicious. 
- Let's hope we get it.

208
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,880
Botanical bakers, you have an hour left on your citrus meringue.

209
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,520
My curd's looking quite nice. Had a little taste. It's really tart.

210
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,360
Which is good. Makes you go...

211
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,520
Getting the right consistency of their fillings is crucial.

212
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,120
It's taking so long to thicken.

213
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,280
Too thin and it won't set.

214
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,720
It's a bit slow, going to put some cornflour in there. We'll see.

215
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,480
Too thick and the curd could end up lumpy and solid.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I just need to be careful not to curdle it.

217
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,560
I can feel it thickening nicely, actually. You get this nice

218
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,440
silky, smooth, flavoured curd, but without all the bits.

219
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,800
It is beginning up now, so it's good. It's just, you've got to wait,

220
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
you've just got to wait for these things, can't rush it.

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Take that off the heat for a minute. Just while I check the bottom.

222
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm just taking it off for the blind bake.

223
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,920
Not quite as brown as I'd have liked, but...

224
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
I think I rolled it out slightly thicker than I normally do.

225
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,520
Just wait for it to go down a little bit.

226
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Soggy bottom would ruin the whole thing.

227
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,480
This is now going back in.

228
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,480
While some have decided to bake their fillings...

229
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
Going into the fridge.

230
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
..Rav and Andrew are just chilling.

231
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,200
- Just going to dump this in the fridge.
- Yeah, do it.

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,440
- Bloomin' good.
- I'm chilling the pie because I want the curd to be set.

233
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,040
If it's not set, once you cut into it, it'll just be a gloopy mess

234
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,800
and I don't want that to happen when Mary and Paul cut into it.

235
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,840
45 minutes remaining.

236
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,120
Just got to crack on with my meringue.

237
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,720
To create the perfect meringue,

238
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,480
the bakers must whisk the egg whites and sugar into soft peaks.

239
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,920
So I'm just going to add in my sugar, bit by bit,

240
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,760
so it doesn't collapse on me.

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,200
If the meringue isn't robust enough, it won't hold its shape when piped.

242
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
It's not quite there,

243
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,440
so I'm just going to allow it to whisk some more.

244
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm not happy. It needs to be nice and thick.

245
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
I wanted to get stiff peaks.

246
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,360
The bowl should be cold, and it's just a wee bit warm,

247
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,440
so I'll give it another minute.

248
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
Coming out.

249
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,280
Delighted with it. It's set really nicely.

250
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,800
Happy with that, looks good. We'll get some meringue on it.

251
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,480
I guess I would have liked it to be a bit stiffer.

252
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not how it's intended to be.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
I think I've under-whipped it.

254
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm not hugely happy with how stiff my meringue is.

255
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,920
I've got two layers of meringue going on.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,760
I've mixed coconut in the bottom layer

257
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,240
cos I didn't want to pipe this cos it's hard to pipe.

258
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,440
The coconut's got stuck in the nozzle. So I think the coconut's

259
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,200
just a little bit bigger than what it was at home.

260
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,400
It all got stuck, so I've just swirled it altogether.

261
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,880
It just looks horrendous.

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
OK, you beautiful bouquet of bakers,

263
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,680
you've got ten minutes left on the citrus meringue challenge.

264
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm making the blood orange syrup in the pan.

265
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,400
It's going in the oven for about five minutes.

266
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,800
I want a brown, but not blowtorched look on the meringue.

267
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Are you blowtorching?

268
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,760
I think it just looks better, you can control where you brown it.

269
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you saying the blowtorch could be the difference

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,240
- between you and Selasi? 
- I think it could be.

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,880
- What's going on? 
- It's horrendous.

272
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,640
Give it a bit of blowtorchery and then do a bit of zhuzh-ery,

273
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,560
then you'll be absolutely fine.

274
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,160
Bakers, you've got one minute left on this.

275
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,240
Mine is so wet.

276
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,400
I've put in a little bit of egg white, and then caster sugar on,

277
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,440
to frost my mint leaves for my decoration,

278
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,120
to try and make it not look as absolutely horrendous as it does.

279
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,560
All done.

280
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,520
There's nothing I can do.

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
OK, botanical bakers, the bake is over.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is your meringue OK?

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,920
- Mine's awful. 
- I couldn't get it to whip up.

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,520
THUNDER RUMBLES

285
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,680
Paul and Mary are looking for a large citrus meringue pie

286
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,120
with a well-baked pastry base, a zesty citrus filling,

287
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,360
topped with a layer of meringue.

288
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
The overall appearance is lovely.

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,440
It's a difficult flavour, grapefruit,

290
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,320
it's difficult to get any strength in it.

291
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,520
It'll be interesting to see how we've got on.

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,160
Ooh, that went straight through.

293
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,280
We've got a lovely proportion of pastry, filling and topping.

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,280
The grapefruit comes through beautifully.

295
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,040
Absolutely smashed that out of the park, the curd.

296
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,120
It is sharp. The grapefruit complements the topping.

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,200
- I think you've actually done a very, very good job.
- Thank you.

298
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,520
You've got good meringue, good piping, your pastry's a good colour.

299
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,400
- Looks good to me.
- Thank you.

300
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,000
Wow, that's really holding, isn't it?

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,120
No movement in that whatsoever.

302
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,960
The flavour is stunning, but it's the curd that's the problem on that,

303
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,760
- it's too dry.
- The filling, for me, is too stiff and cloying.

304
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,400
Too much thickening.

305
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
I wanted more volume from it,

306
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,360
a bit more height. It's falling down the sides.

307
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
It didn't whip up as much as I would have liked it to.

308
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,760
- No.
- But that's a little bit too soft.
- Yeah.

309
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,800
You can't even see the curd in there at all.

310
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,320
I'm just looking at the pastry underneath, if I can find it.

311
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,640
- Good luck with that, Mary. 
- It looks good.
- Yeah, looks good.

312
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,360
The pastry tastes good and I like the little bit of mandarin

313
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,000
in the pastry, that was good.

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,240
I am getting a hint of tequila right at the end.

315
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,600
But the flavour's not strong enough.

316
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,840
OK.

317
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Pastry looks a good colour,

318
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,000
we can see that you've piped your meringue.

319
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
We didn't quite get the volume,

320
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,600
and you ran out of meringue when you got to the middle.

321
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,760
- That is very thick. That's nearly the same thickness as your curd.
- Mm.

322
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
That curd is absolutely beautiful.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,960
You've got it right.

324
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,840
Sharp underneath, which we expect from the curd,

325
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,960
sweet on top, which is the meringue.

326
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
Pastry too thick, not quite done in the middle.

327
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
- OK.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

328
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,680
What I'm concerned about is that line there.

329
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,640
That's underdone pastry.

330
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,520
The meringue is hugely sweet and it's very, very soft.

331
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,680
The pumpkin is sweet, the topping is sweet.

332
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,240
Tasting that, I wouldn't know citrus was there at all.

333
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,680
I like the idea of the coconut being on the top,

334
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,120
it does look quite attractive.

335
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm fascinated to see what this base is going to be like, though.

336
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,920
And you've done it in the oven, and that's how I like my meringue done.

337
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,680
- Oh, yes.
- Holding well on the knife. 
- Oh, yes.

338
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,240
There is just the right amount of lime with that.

339
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,880
And the coconut's coming through.

340
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,320
- I like it.
- Oh, thank you.

341
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,120
Overall, I'm not very happy with the appearance.

342
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,400
The colour looks a bit odd and more height would be good.

343
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,200
The pastry base looks all right, I'm just wondering about these wilted

344
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
leaves sort of sitting on the side.

345
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,320
It's a very wet meringue, that, isn't it, as well?

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,880
The actual curd itself is very good flavour.

347
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,240
- Thank you. Tart. 
- It's delicious.

348
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,440
- It's excellent.
- Meringue tastes OK, just looks awful.

349
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
OK!

350
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,280
Wasn't supposed to be that green.

351
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,040
But it was very green. But close your eyes, it tastes really good,

352
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,080
actually, and I'm really happy with how it tastes.

353
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,080
I think some of the comments they made are absolutely fair.

354
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,880
But I think that was a citrus pie.

355
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,080
My curd came out quite well. And his, it's not even funny,

356
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,240
his came out a bit too thick after all that.

357
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,160
That didn't go that well. Makes me a bit anxious going back into the tent

358
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,160
to deal with the Technical. The pressure's kind of on a bit.

359
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,160
OK, bakers, it's time for your botanical Technical,

360
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,520
which today is set for you by the whimsical, yet maniacal uncle Paul.

361
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Paul, any words of wisdom for the gang?

362
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,800
Be patient and remember the shaping.

363
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,880
A bit of a catchphrase, that, for Paul.

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,040
- Enigmatic. Paul and Mary, we don't need you for this bit.
- No.

365
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,400
Because you will be judging blind, so off you go, into the garden.

366
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
There are some messy bushes that need trimming.

367
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,760
Right, now they have disappeared, I can announce your Technical.

368
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,640
Of course, botanicals aren't just about citrus flavourings,

369
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
they're about herbal flavourings.

370
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,160
Paul would like you to make a French classic -

371
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,560
two herb fougasse.

372
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,920
You've got two hours on your Technical Challenge, bakers.

373
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,680
- On your marks.
- Get set. 
- BOTH:
- Bake.

374
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,640
I've heard of it but never made it before, so...

375
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah, we'll see.

376
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,720
I know what a fougasse should look like, I've eaten fougasse.

377
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,440
So that's a plus.

378
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,520
I've never made one before, that's the only thing.

379
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
Paul, why have you chosen fougasse as the Technical Challenge?

380
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,200
Because it's botanical week, fougasse is leaf-shaped in its cut.

381
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,840
Now, they have to be quite careful with this.

382
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,320
Just use your fingers, stretch it out

383
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,400
and then make two slashes down the middle and six diagonal slashes

384
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,440
on both sides, so it looks like a leaf,

385
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,240
so we're going to break this off... You can hear that straightaway.

386
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,360
Immediately you pick that up, it smells of those herbs

387
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,040
and using fresh herbs makes all the difference, doesn't it?

388
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,800
It's got that lovely crunchy outside

389
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
and as soon as you get in the middle,

390
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,320
- there's a little bit of spring. 
- That's it.

391
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,280
That's a fougasse. If they're good, Mary,

392
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
and they're careful and they follow the recipe,

393
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,160
we should end up with 14 spectacular, flawless fougasse.

394
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
No problem.

395
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
So, the first line says, "Make the dough by mixing the flour, salt,

396
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,040
"yeast and oil and three quarters of the water."

397
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,320
I think that's pretty straightforward.

398
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
"As the dough starts to come together,

399
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,280
"slowly add the remaining water." Which I'm doing.

400
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,160
I don't know if it's supposed to be, like, super wet or not.

401
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm just trying to knead it in a bit at a time.

402
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,520
I love fougasse, it's one of my favourite things.

403
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,120
It's actually my cinema snack.

404
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,600
And I like bread.

405
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
Bread makes me feel happy and comfortable.

406
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,640
I don't think it needs much working.

407
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
I've just stopped adding the water cos I think it will make it too wet.

408
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,480
It looks like a standard white bread recipe.

409
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,760
It says, "As the dough starts to come together, then add the herbs."

410
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,720
So, we've got two teaspoons of sage, two teaspoons of thyme,

411
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,760
and two teaspoons of rosemary.

412
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,040
Just doing this at speed, so we can get a nice prove on the dough.

413
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm just going to leave it nice and wet -

414
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,360
because there wasn't a step that was like, "Knead the dough."

415
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,080
It's actually quite a nice-feeling dough.

416
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,480
It's coming together.

417
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,200
Yeah, that passes the window pane test. I'm going to get that in.

418
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
It says "prove".

419
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,440
Doesn't list how long we're supposed to prove it for.

420
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,440
I guess we have to kind of use our own baking instincts.

421
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I just put my dough in my proving draw.

422
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm going to leave it there for 40 minutes and then we'll take a view.

423
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
I can leave it for an hour.

424
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm going to prove it for 45 minutes.

425
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,160
Don't want to over prove it.

426
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,680
So now we just wait.

427
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
Two leaf-shaped fougasse.

428
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,200
So...

429
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,040
It just says, "Slash each fougasse,

430
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,960
"with two consecutive cuts down the middle and six on either side."

431
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,040
Six on either side. One, two, three, four, five, six.

432
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,600
Consecutive could mean one, two.

433
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Or it could mean one, two.

434
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm from an engineering background, consecutive is one after the other.

435
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,560
It's supposed to look like a leaf

436
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,920
and I'm now erring towards one on top of the other.

437
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah.

438
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,400
OK, my rootin', tootin' gluten-shootin' bakers,

439
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
you've got one hour, that's it, one hour left.

440
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,480
Ooh! We've got a good rise.

441
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,440
It's doubled in size.

442
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Probably tripled in size, actually.

443
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,840
It says, "Divide in half and shape into two leaf-shaped fougasse."

444
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640
My, my. That's sticky.

445
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,120
Leaf, like that.

446
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm just slashing my fougasse.

447
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
I've gone for the one after the other...

448
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,760
and I've committed now.

449
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,120
This is starting to look like what I've eaten. To be honest with you,

450
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,520
I can't remember exactly if the slits were in the middle like that.

451
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,680
My consecutive lines are one on top of the other.

452
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,280
I think two on either side wouldn't have given me much space

453
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,880
to do the slits on the side.

454
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,600
I've cut the lines in the middle, which doesn't look right.

455
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,040
I don't know. It'll be nice.

456
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,280
Let's not forget that in bread week, who was Star Baker?

457
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,480
I don't know, I can't remember.

458
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
- No, it was me.
- Tom!

459
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,280
- Yeah.
- So this is good territory for you.

460
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,040
- Yeah. I'm feeling that's quite pretty.
- Yeah, it looks lovely.

461
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,000
Are you going to prove those again now?

462
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,040
- Yeah.
- So these are your little proving sheaths.

463
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
- Yes, exactly!
- And you just leave them in there, do you?

464
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,520
Yeah, I think I'm going to prove these at room temperature...

465
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,840
- OK, love.
- ..just because I won't get two of them in the proving drawer.

466
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,000
Get as much air as possible in there, and then it can go...

467
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,840
Start its second prove.

468
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,160
I'll give it 20 minutes' prove.

469
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm probably just going to prove it on the side.

470
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,640
I won't stick it in the drawer.

471
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm going to prove that for 25 minutes, maybe.

472
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm going to probably prove it for...

473
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,040
..another 30 minutes or so.

474
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,200
Fingers crossed.

475
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,480
Oh, God! I've never been so stressed about dough in my life.

476
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,960
OK, bakers, 30 minutes till we need to see your fougasse-ious material

477
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,080
on the table.

478
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,920
Do you know what? I think I'm going to go in.

479
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,200
Proving is finished. It's not risen much.

480
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,040
All right, I'm going to go for it.

481
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,840
So I'm brushing it with olive oil

482
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,040
and then I'll sprinkle some oregano on -

483
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,000
that's what the instructions say.

484
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I'm going to put it in for ten minutes.

485
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,760
They're both going in.

486
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,360
He said, "Be patient," didn't he?

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,160
I think Selasi thinks we've got more time than we do.

488
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,240
Because it's got to bake and it's got to cool.

489
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
I'm just going to take my time

490
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,840
and just do it the right time and not rush it.

491
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
20 minutes remaining.

492
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Most French ovens are steam injected ovens, so it's a French bread,

493
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
my thought process goes, put some steam in there.

494
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,120
- Did you go for steam? 
- No. Because I thought...

495
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,000
I mean, I know it's not a focaccia, but it feels like a focaccia.

496
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,240
And I wouldn't put steam in my focaccia.

497
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
- Mm.
- But I don't know.

498
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,920
OK, bakers, 15 minutes and we're all going to need fou-gastric bands

499
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,480
because they'll be so delicious.

500
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,560
OK, I'm running out of time now. Time to bake it.

501
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,680
Cook, cook, cook.

502
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,840
It's rising, which is good.

503
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,800
It's looking like I would expect a fougasse to...

504
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,480
I would buy this fougasse.

505
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Doesn't look good. I think it might be underbaked...

506
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,120
- ..which I don't want. 
- You are so Zen.

507
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
It's looking really puffed up,

508
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,960
so maybe I should've stretched it out more.

509
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,080
Bakers, that's five minutes remaining on your bakes.

510
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,480
I mean, it feels hollow.

511
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,400
One minute for good luck.

512
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Hopefully OK. It's supposed to be quite flat.

513
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,480
- Yeah. Good.
- I've got one more minute left in the oven

514
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,200
- and we've got three minutes left. 
- So, two minutes for cooling.

515
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,240
Two minutes for cooling.

516
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,520
I think it's done. It's better than having it in the oven

517
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,640
and being worried that they're not.

518
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,840
That feels right to me.

519
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,800
A thing of beauty!

520
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,440
I get so excited by bread.

521
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,440
Happy with that.

522
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,400
That is not cooked.

523
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,280
I don't understand that.

524
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm going to spend my remaining one minute wafting like a maniac.

525
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,760
I've got... Just got pale portions in the middle.

526
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,240
Damn it! Maybe I shouldn't have steamed.

527
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Coming out.

528
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,840
It looks underbaked.

529
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,360
OK, bakers, time is up on the fougasse.

530
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,400
Please bring them up.

531
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,120
Paul and Mary are looking for 14 leaf-shaped herb fougasse.

532
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,040
As they're judging blind, they have no idea whose bread is whose.

533
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,560
Start from this side, Mary.

534
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,000
Now, the idea of a fougasse, when you cut the diagonal lines,

535
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,520
it's to make it look like a leaf.

536
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
The lines are meant to go one, two.

537
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,160
It's not a bad bake, actually. You can see the herbs on the top.

538
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,720
They look nice.

539
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,640
Nice and crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.

540
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,120
This is exactly how I wanted to see it.

541
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,040
Two down the middle. Six, each side.

542
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,640
That's a nice one, that one.

543
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,120
- Nice flavour.
- It is baked.

544
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,280
That's the key thing, it is baked, and it does taste good.

545
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,960
This is a little bit smaller and the cuts are in the wrong place again.

546
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,160
It's very spongy, isn't it, in the middle?

547
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,920
Could have flattened that one out a bit.

548
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,880
It's a bit small. You can fill the tray right to the edge.

549
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,760
The bake's good, though. This one needed a bit more in the oven.

550
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,600
See by the colour underneath, how pale that is?

551
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
- You want it to be crispy. 
- It's spongy, isn't it?

552
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah. More like a flowery bap.

553
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,480
The cuts are wrong.

554
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,360
- It isn't crisp at all.
- No.

555
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,480
Moving on, again, cuts in the wrong place.

556
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,320
Should've been more leaf-like.

557
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,840
But they are opened up a bit more, so it's filled the tray.

558
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,760
Needed a little bit longer.

559
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,680
Again, it's not crisp on the outside.

560
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,800
That's not bad. It just needed longer in the oven.

561
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,720
It's got a stronger bake. You can see the brown underneath.

562
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,280
It's crispy all the way round, which I like.

563
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,680
- Mmm, it's good. 
- With a bit of cheese.

564
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,600
- Cheese.
- Ooh, cheese.
- Wine.

565
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,360
- Wine!
- That's nice.

566
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,520
Moving on to the last one, cuts in the right place.

567
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,240
Could've done with another five minutes in the oven.

568
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,840
It's a bit soft here and crispy on the outside.

569
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,720
Your flavour's there. The bake isn't.

570
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,040
Mary and Paul will now reveal whose herb fougasse

571
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
is technically perfect.

572
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,520
In seventh place is this one, Selasi.

573
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Too soft. Cuts in the wrong place.

574
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,800
In sixth place, this one was slightly underbaked.

575
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,720
In fifth place is this one.

576
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,800
The cuts are in the wrong place and, actually,

577
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,960
- could've done with a little bit longer, as well.
- In fourth place...

578
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,080
The cuts aren't in the right place.

579
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,200
In third place is this one.

580
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,520
You could've done with opening those up a bit,

581
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,960
but the crispiness of that was delicious. Well done.

582
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
In second place, a very nice bake.

583
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Lovely and crispy.

584
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,480
So, first place, this one.

585
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,000
Brilliant.

586
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
THEY CLAP

587
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,320
That's a good fougasse, Tom.

588
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,440
- Well done.
- Yes!

589
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,280
I think that's the closest I've come to crying in the tent, yet,

590
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,840
out of just sheer relief and joy.

591
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
Sometimes things don't go your way,

592
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,960
so I need to pull something out of the bag again.

593
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,120
Out of the hat? Bag?

594
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,880
I want, tomorrow, to have an absolutely amazing cake,

595
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,000
and I want them to go, "Wow, now that's what I call a Showstopper."

596
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,160
If tomorrow's average or worse, I could be going home.

597
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,480
The bakers have one final botanical challenge to impress Mary and Paul -

598
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,320
the Showstopper. One more chance to keep their place in the tent.

599
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,400
Now, Mary and Paul, it seems to me that this weekend,

600
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
we're seeing the triumph of girls and the slow wilting of the boys.

601
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,840
The girls are coming through with flying colours

602
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,520
- and the boys are sinking back.
- Mmm. A little like the meringues.

603
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,560
Let's start at the top.

604
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,880
Benjamina's had a good weekend so far, hasn't she?

605
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
Benjamina's flown away.

606
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,720
I mean, she's been consistent, actually, over the weeks, now.

607
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,480
Doing pretty well, we've got Candice.

608
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
A good tasting meringue.

609
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh, it was a beautiful curd, and good pastry.

610
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
I mean, Jane is strong again.

611
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,760
And she had made a very good meringue and she was one of the few

612
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,440
that, when she piped it, it kept its shape.

613
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Andrew, up to now, has been, sort of, pretty consistent, hasn't he?

614
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Should we be worrying about him now?

615
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,440
I think Selasi and Andrew and, dare I say it, Rav.

616
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,200
- Oh, dear.
- I need to bring Tom in, as well.

617
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,920
The pumpkin, it didn't taste very good.

618
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Very stodgy. He did come first in technical.

619
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,440
- Yeah.
- But that was quite tight, anyway, in technical,

620
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,880
so I wouldn't discount Tom at this stage.

621
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
I would say, at the moment,

622
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,640
all the lads are in trouble coming into the Showstopper.

623
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,160
- Every single male baker is in trouble?
- Yes.

624
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,280
Welcome back, bakers, to your botanical Showstopper day.

625
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,560
Now, Paul and Mary would love you, please,

626
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,000
to make a spectacular floral cake,

627
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,320
and here is the floral dance to go with that cake.

628
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,120
I can hear her hips when they move.

629
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,280
Good. They'd like it, please, to have at least three tiers.

630
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,000
You can use flowers in it.

631
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,240
You can use flowers on it, in the icing.

632
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,240
You can decorate with flowers. You can fill with flowers.

633
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,200
You've got four hours, so...

634
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
- On your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake.

635
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,000
I think everyone's, kind of, on edge a bit,

636
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,560
because there's a lot riding on the Showstopper.

637
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,880
And I certainly don't want to go home yet!

638
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm just really nervous.

639
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,920
I have got quite a lot going on today.

640
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,840
However, they are all cakes that I enjoy making, so, hopefully,

641
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,800
as long as I can get them in the oven,

642
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,680
then let the decorating commence.

643
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm worried that the judges might think

644
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,320
it's just not got enough of a wow factor,

645
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,360
so I'm going to try and make it look as beautiful

646
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,520
and finessed as possible.

647
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,960
We've asked them to make a three-tier floral cake.

648
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,320
I think of roses, elderflower, lavender...

649
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,400
To get that light, floral flavour coming through is very tricky,

650
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,560
and, in some cases, can be very overpowering.

651
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,040
- They'll have to be careful. 
- The other thing, of course,

652
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,520
is all about the decoration. It's got to look exceptional.

653
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I hope they're inspired to do something very special.

654
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm doing, erm, a Mary classic in that I am doing all-in-ones, so,

655
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,080
basically, you don't cream the butter and the sugar separately.

656
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
For speed, you just shove it all in.

657
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,280
- Good morning, Andrew.
- Morning! 
- Tell us about your floral cake.

658
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,800
So, I'm making a fruity spring elderflower cake.

659
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,360
So, on my base layer, I'm going to have a cherry and almond sponge,

660
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,800
my middle one is going to be a lemon and elderflower drizzle,

661
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,800
and then the top is going to be a hidden strawberry vanilla cake.

662
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,720
Andrew's floral Showstopper will use fresh strawberries,

663
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,880
chopped glace cherries and Kirsch liqueur.

664
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,880
He'll then decorate his three tiers of sponge with real flowers.

665
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,720
What are you covering the whole thing with?

666
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,160
So, I'm making a Swiss buttercream,

667
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,560
which I'm going to flavour with a bit of elderflower cordial

668
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,160
and mainly this elderflower extract,

669
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,560
- which is very strong, so I'll use it sparingly...
- Sparingly.

670
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,480
..just give it a nice fragrant... But not overpower it.

671
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,520
- Get a good...
- Good luck, Andrew.
- OK. 
- Thank you.
- Cheers. Thank you.

672
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,720
I'm not much of a floral guy at all, if I'm honest with you,

673
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,280
so the fact that I've chosen to pipe my own buttercream flowers,

674
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,000
I've really set myself a challenge here today.

675
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,760
Hiding beneath Rav's piped flowers will be three tiers

676
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,640
of orange blossom, almond and vanilla flavour sponge,

677
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,200
covered in a Swiss meringue buttercream.

678
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,920
I've only gone for one flavour for all three of my tiers,

679
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
because I thought that would, kind of, make it slightly easier

680
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,920
than worrying about having to make different flavours for each tier.

681
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,320
These are camomile flowers

682
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,000
which I'm just crushing up into a fine powder,

683
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,880
and I'm going to steep in the hot butter

684
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
to go into the genoise sponge.

685
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,160
As soon as I heard that we were making a floral cake,

686
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,800
I immediately started thinking about, like, floral teas.

687
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,080
I really like jasmine tea, camomile tea, all those sorts of things.

688
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,000
Tom is piping elderflower buttercream rosettes

689
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,560
to entirely cover his trio

690
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,760
of tea-infused genoise sponges.

691
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,880
What worries me is some of the flavours you've come up with

692
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,080
have been out there, and is tea really going to blow our mind

693
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,680
- in a Showstopper, in a sponge? 
- It does come through, you know.

694
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,440
It doesn't just taste like it's not there.

695
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,640
I'm hoping to convince you that tea in a dessert actually works.

696
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,200
- Good on you.
- Well, we'll see. 
- Thank you, Tom.

697
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,360
OK, that's one out.

698
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,840
I am making a four-tier...

699
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,800
..changing of the seasons...

700
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
..floral cake.

701
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,280
The seasons are all very, very different, so I'm, kind of,

702
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,000
going for showing that through cake form.

703
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,240
Candice's four seasons cake

704
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,160
begins with a chocolate and orange blossom

705
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,560
layer for spring, a lemon, raspberry and rose for summer,

706
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,160
spiced carrot for autumn, and a fruitcake for winter.

707
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm going for all different sizes, all different shapes.

708
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,320
- Wow.
- And my top tier, which I'm just finishing off,

709
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,120
is my nan's boiled fruitcake, and the only...

710
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,440
- That is it. 
- Is that your nan's writing?

711
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,160
- That is my nan's writing. 
- That makes me so very happy.

712
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,720
That is what baking is all about.

713
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
- Yeah.
- Just in one little, tiny sheet of paper.

714
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,280
- Yeah.
- You've got a mammoth task ahead of you.

715
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,680
- OK. Good luck.
- Thank you so much. 
- Thank you, Candice.

716
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,360
I'm not using any real flowers, which, actually, in hindsight,

717
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,080
possibly is an error, because it would be so much quicker.

718
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,600
So, there's a lot to get done,

719
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
but I think I've got my timings in my head.

720
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,480
Garden designer Jane is going all out with her floral decoration,

721
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,680
making her own sugar-paste flowers and floral chocolate collars

722
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,760
to wrap around each of her three tiers of orange-flavoured sponges.

723
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,320
To go down a floral challenge and do a floral decoration

724
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,680
- rather than flavours is... 
- Rather than floral flavours?

725
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,640
- Yeah.
- I thought, I'll do a lovely orange,

726
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
which is a flowery flavour anyway,

727
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,560
and just shove as much flower on the outside as I can.

728
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,760
Let's hope that your flowers on the top excel.

729
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,560
I hope so. I've practised them an awful lot.

730
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
You've got to gamble a bit at this, week six of Bake Off.

731
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,280
I just hope I haven't made a wrong choice, really, today.

732
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,920
This is the cherry and almond. I'm happy with the consistency.

733
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,440
I think I've got my cherries dispersed pretty evenly

734
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
throughout the mix.

735
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,200
20 minutes, that's going in for.

736
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,880
- Good.
- Speed, to me, today, is huge, because I'm doing chocolate collars

737
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,080
and a chocolate ganache underneath.

738
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,760
It's all got to be dead cold, so getting these in and chilled

739
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,960
is really, really important.

740
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm on cake number two, now - the lemon and strawberry layer cake.

741
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm making a three-tiered cake and they're going to be stacked up

742
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,480
and I'll be piping round it to the top,

743
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,400
add some glitter and some flowers.

744
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,800
Selasi is making three tiers of different flavoured sponge -

745
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,960
carrot,

746
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,240
strawberry and vanilla, and lemon and poppy seed.

747
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,440
He'll decorate each layer with pink and white piped rosettes.

748
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,640
The girls have definitely been very, very strong,

749
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,600
whereas the guys are almost going through...

750
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,360
I'm going to represent the boys, the flag for the lads.

751
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,680
Three...

752
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm doing a camomile, honey and poppy seed cake for two of my tiers,

753
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,760
and I'm just infusing my milk with some dried camomile flowers,

754
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,800
and then a little bit of honey. So, it's very floral.

755
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,560
Benjamina is sandwiching an orange blossom and almond cake

756
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,600
between two camomile-infused sponges,

757
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,960
which she'll only partially cover in frosting.

758
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,120
It's going to be, like, semi-naked iced.

759
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,600
- Semi-naked?
- Yeah.

760
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,440
So it's not completely frosted.

761
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,800
I've never heard that... I've never heard those terms.

762
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
So you see a bit of the cake peeping through.

763
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,600
And then I've just got some fresh flowers. It's quite simple.

764
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,160
- Good luck. Thank you, Benjamina. 
- Thank you.

765
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,080
Six tablespoons of poppy seeds.

766
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,720
A little bit too much mix.

767
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,840
It may take a bit long to bake, but, you know, too late now.

768
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,480
I'm just worried about the timing.

769
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
Ideally would've liked this to have been in the oven

770
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,480
within half an hour of us starting - so, way behind time.

771
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,040
Bakers, two hours gone, two hours to go.

772
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm going to put them in now.

773
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,320
All right, I'm going into the oven.

774
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,680
This is browning very quickly, actually - I don't know why.

775
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,040
The mixture doesn't look right.

776
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,840
The oven looks as though it was a bit too hot, so rather than risk it,

777
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm going to take it out and chuck it away.

778
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,680
It's probably put me 20 minutes where I didn't want to be.

779
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm really pleased with my chocolate cake, actually.

780
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,560
It's looking quite nice.

781
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,720
I've just put my second lot in. We shall see.

782
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,720
All right, that's me done.

783
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,320
All done. All seem good.

784
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,400
That smells of elderflower.

785
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,720
That smells of camomile.

786
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,960
That smells of jasmine. I'm happy.

787
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,720
Grr!

788
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,320
This one's a tad overdone.

789
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,640
I don't know why it's still so moist in the middle.

790
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,800
It's just that's the leftover elderflower cordial.

791
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,800
With three tiers to bake...

792
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,320
It's not cooked, man.

793
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
..and decorate, timing is crucial.

794
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,400
Ideally, I'd wait until this was totally cool before cutting it.

795
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,360
I'm going to give myself an hour for icing and decorating.

796
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,680
Because I'll be piping a lot of roses outside,

797
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,520
I need to make a lot of mix.

798
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,080
I need to start making flowers.

799
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,400
I've just put some food colouring into my buttercream,

800
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
which is going to be used to pipe my buttercream flowers.

801
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,200
It tastes like elderflowers.

802
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,920
I just can't tell any more.

803
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,760
Oh. Oh. I got it that time.

804
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,080
Because I haven't got flowers in my cake,

805
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,200
my decoration is absolutely crucial.

806
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,320
I don't know why I've chosen to pipe my own flowers.

807
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,680
It's good. It shows a skill.

808
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,280
- I hope so.
- Do you like doing this sort of careful...

809
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,200
- I hate it.
- Oh.

810
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,560
- Oh, Rav.
- I know that this cake has to look good,

811
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,680
and I don't do pretty with my bakes, so I'm really, really worried.

812
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,240
It's cooked. Yeah. Fortunately.

813
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,120
OK, they caught on the side, though. It'll have to do.

814
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,880
Oh, that looks good. Look at that.

815
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,080
That was supposed to be done half an hour ago.

816
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,040
I think I just put, probably, a bit too much mix, but...

817
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,680
Listen, you'll just have to slightly speed up.

818
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,720
OK.

819
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,880
Come on, bakers. We've not got all daisy!

820
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,680
Half an hour, in fact.

821
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,040
- Just half an hour left.
- Oh, no!

822
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,080
I was thinking, like, the pictures you see of Japanese blossom gardens.

823
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,960
I'm basically just wanting a really clean finish on it,

824
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,120
so I'm just crumb-coating each of these at the moment.

825
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,920
I hope they understand that seeing the cake come through a little bit

826
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,240
- is intentional.
- I'm trying to fill in all the holes.

827
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,160
I don't think I'm doing a very good job, though.

828
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,080
Personal taste, personal taste.

829
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,040
Looking at everybody else's, I've got no chance.

830
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,280
Look at Candice's in front of me.

831
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,840
Selasi has got some good decorations going on. Oh, God!

832
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
These are my chocolate wraps.

833
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,640
What I've done, is just melted white chocolate and coloured it up.

834
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,800
So, the positioning of the cake

835
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,720
is supposed to be a little bit higgledy-piggledy,

836
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,560
just like the seasons.

837
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,560
That's going to have to do. Next, putting on the flowers.

838
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,400
I wish I'd chosen fresh flowers now.

839
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,840
Just as well this is an abstract cake wrap.

840
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,480
Oh, gosh, they're all soft.

841
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,560
I'm going to have to put them in the freezer for a bit.

842
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,600
Chuck the flowers on.

843
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,640
I just want it to look very, kind of, clean and elegant,

844
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,680
and I'm going to have some tumbling down one side.

845
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,520
My piping skills are pretty good, actually.

846
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,760
I need it to be good enough and taste good enough, so, let's see.

847
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,840
You fill in the gaps and then, hopefully,

848
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,840
once it's all set and wrapped round the cake,

849
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,760
it'll cover a multitude of sins.

850
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,560
I've got the most difficult thing to do at the end,

851
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,880
which is to try and pipe some roses in the middle.

852
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,480
You've got five minutes left.

853
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,600
I'm just getting my chocolate wraps on.

854
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,800
I would normally not put them on quite so wet, but needs must...

855
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,000
That will have to do.

856
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,880
This is a complete mess.

857
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,120
That's looking a lot better than the practice one I made.

858
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,600
It's just piping on some...

859
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,120
some of my ganache.

860
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,640
OK, bakers, that's time.

861
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,880
So, bakers, to the end of your benches, please.

862
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,680
That looks absolutely terrible.

863
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,560
Paul and Mary are looking for three tiers of cake,

864
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,480
inspired by botanical flavours

865
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,480
and finished with elaborate floral decorations.

866
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,400
Candice, I'm amazed that you did those four tiers.

867
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,960
The overall appearance is fun.

868
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,240
- It's like you, isn't it?
- Yeah. 
- You like to do things over the top.

869
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,680
Right, we'll start with your...

870
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,040
- Winter is coming! 
- ..Nan's boiled fruit.

871
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,520
- Nice flavour.
- Thank you.

872
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,160
- Well done, Gran.
- So, there's winter.

873
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,320
- Coming into autumn.
- This is autumn.

874
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,760
- The nut's come through.
- OK. 
- The texture's OK.

875
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,080
- It's a little bit rubbery.
- OK. 
- But the flavour is OK.

876
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,680
- OK.
- Right, moving onto the next one.

877
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,200
Summer's here.

878
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,240
Often, when you put rose in, it overpowers it.

879
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,080
- It doesn't. That's a good cake. 
- Thank you.
- Lastly, with spring...

880
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,000
Chocolate orange and almond, and it's gluten-free, as well.

881
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,680
- It's a good chocolate cake. 
- Thank you.

882
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,280
That's a good example because it's difficult to get a good cake

883
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,240
gluten-free, and it is good.

884
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,560
So, overall, I like your chocolate cake.

885
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,440
I like the fruitcake on the top. Summer was pretty good.

886
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,720
- Your carrot cake let you down a bit. 
- OK.

887
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,880
I'd like to have seen a different decoration

888
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,560
other than just that you can pipe single blobs all the way around.

889
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,680
Right, so the top one is vanilla sponge.

890
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,440
Interesting strawberry in the middle.

891
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,760
And that's just cream, is it?

892
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,000
No, that's the elderflower Swiss buttercream.

893
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,640
I'm looking for the flavour. I can't...

894
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,160
It should be quite subtle. I didn't want it to...

895
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,160
- It's quite easy to go... 
- It's so subtle, I can't find it.

896
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,720
Right, let's have a look at the next layer.

897
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,200
This is the lemon and elderflower drizzle.

898
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,000
It's over-baked, that one. It's dry as a bone.

899
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,600
- And this bottom one again? 
- It is a cherry and almond.

900
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,800
They've all gathered in one little area.

901
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,360
Well, what's happened is the mixture was too slack.

902
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,920
The cake is quite dry, again. Quite close.

903
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,320
That's not good. That's a shame.

904
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,000
I like the look of the cake.

905
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,680
I... It just, for me, feels a bit unfinished.

906
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,160
OK. The bottom and the top one are the camomile-honey

907
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,080
and the middle one is orange.

908
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,560
It's not quite done.

909
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,920
- Mmm.
- There is a layer, here, of rather close mixture.

910
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,680
It was taken out of the oven a little bit too soon.

911
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,840
I can't get that tea coming through.

912
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,320
Let's go for the second layer.

913
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,560
The orange is coming through strongly and well.

914
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,400
That is absolutely spot on.

915
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,000
It's a shame about the top one and probably the bottom one.

916
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,360
Try the bottom one. It might be better.

917
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,440
Again, I can't taste the tea.

918
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,240
It's a bit of a mess when it comes to the icing.

919
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,720
When you go for a classic look, make sure it's really smooth.

920
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,320
The flowers, I think they could've been a bit bolder in their colour.

921
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
One, two, three.

922
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,040
I think it is slightly over-baked. That's a shame.

923
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,240
I think, really, that the cake itself is not very creative.

924
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,200
Same filling, same colouring.

925
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,320
It's just a bit samey.

926
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,800
Things didn't go completely to plan.

927
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,960
No, they didn't. I ran out of time at the end

928
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,400
and I had to take the acetates off quickly,

929
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
so I haven't got the lovely shine.

930
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,240
It does look a mess.

931
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,720
And it looks like mashed potato in between those cakes.

932
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Some of the flowers look good but the rest of it...

933
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,360
- Yes, I was really dis...
- That's not up to your normal standards.

934
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,040
Sorry, I was really disappointed.

935
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,040
- It's over-baked.
- Oh, is it?

936
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,000
- Oh.
- Mmm.
- Only just over-baked.

937
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,080
I don't know why I had such trouble with cake today.

938
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,760
- I don't know why.
- Now, this is a totally different mix.

939
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,840
- Yeah.
- Now, the bottom one's a little bit better.

940
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,600
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Not much, though.
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I.
- Yeah.

941
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,600
- It's certainly a Showstopper. 
- That is impressive.

942
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,960
You've shown us that you're a very good at piping buttercream.

943
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,680
And, underneath that, I know you've got three different flavours.

944
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,880
- Yes.
- We'll start from the top, and this is the lemon.
- Yeah.

945
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,520
It's baked well. Still got a bit of moisture in there, which is good.

946
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,880
- Thank you.
- Right, next one.

947
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,080
- And this one is...
- Carrot cake.

948
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,320
It's very, very moist.

949
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,280
- It's good. 
- The texture of the cake is good.

950
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,640
And our bottom layer is...

951
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,920
Vanilla and strawberry.

952
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,400
It's a nice-looking cake, too.

953
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,040
I like the flavour and that sponge is baked beautifully.

954
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,240
- Thank you.
- You've done every single layer perfect.

955
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,040
The icing's been good. Well done, Selasi.

956
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,320
- Makes him even more lovable. Look at him.
- Thank you.
- Well done.

957
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,000
You've done a very simple finish,

958
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,920
but it does look very neat.

959
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,920
- Let's try this top one. 
- The top one is an elderflower tea.

960
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,600
Looking at it, you've got a good genoise.

961
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,520
I am definitely getting elderflower,

962
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
and it is coming through in the cake, as well.

963
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,160
Quite tricky to do. Well done.

964
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,520
This is the camomile.

965
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,200
Again, you've got a very good sponge.

966
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,240
- And what have we got on the bottom? 
- This is a green tea and jasmine.

967
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,520
It's very moist. And I'm getting a very pleasant flavour.

968
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,120
I'm really impressed that you've managed to get those flavours

969
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,800
through, especially the jasmine. It's beautiful. Really good.

970
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,040
- Thank you.
- You've absolutely cracked it with brilliant genoise sponges.

971
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,840
- Thank you, Tom.
- Well done, Tom.

972
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
I'm just disappointed with the appearance of it,

973
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,160
because I think it was very important.

974
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,480
Particularly now, in week six, things need to look good.

975
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,880
It's a bit of a disaster.

976
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,680
I didn't think the cakes would be that bad.

977
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,160
It was pretty damning on all angles.

978
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,840
Yeah, I really want to stay. I really do want to stay. Oh!

979
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,120
This has been the hardest judging that we've ever had.

980
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,600
- It's so hard.
- I think at the moment

981
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,800
- we're looking for the people in trouble.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

982
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,680
- I think, for me, it's Rav. 
- It was just a little bit boring.

983
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,200
And I also have to bring Andrew into that, as well.

984
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,000
It was very, very simple, and he only showed us one lot of piping.

985
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,920
Jane, maybe, didn't have so much success today.

986
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,480
What a sadness with Jane.

987
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,800
She was the only person that moulded flowers herself.

988
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,880
She's got the skill - but she had an off day.

989
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,480
And who is in line for Star Baker?

990
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,600
Selasi was last in technical.

991
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,920
Just based on that cake, I've got to put him into the fold,

992
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,200
because that was very special.

993
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,440
And he got the flavours inside perfectly.

994
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,880
I would say Candice was up there, as well.

995
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,280
We got four different flavours. That's one more than everybody else.

996
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,320
Could Tom inch into Star Baker?

997
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,720
Possibly. I think he's had two good challenges, and, today,

998
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,240
he should feel very proud of himself because that is very, very good.

999
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,960
Can I just say? Before we leave the table,

1000
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,840
I will need to cover Benjamina's cake,

1001
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,880
because we are pre-watershed and that is semi-nude.

1002
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,720
That doesn't need to be seen.

1003
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,960
- Not on British television. 
- If you'd like to see it,

1004
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,080
press the red button now.

1005
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,720
Paul and Mary have decided that the award for Star Baker

1006
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,400
goes to a person who, it's fair to say, didn't start off very well,

1007
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,640
but who came back with real grit.

1008
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,760
They put their foot hard on the fougasse pedal,

1009
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,480
and on Showstopper day, it was all about the tea.

1010
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,960
Star Baker is Mr Tea.

1011
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,840
He is Tom Baker.

1012
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,000
- He is Star Baker. Tom, well done. 
- APPLAUSE

1013
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,080
Well done, mate. I'm bad cop.

1014
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,960
This week's was a very, very hard-fought

1015
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,640
and difficult, difficult decision.

1016
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,920
And so, with a very heavy heart, the person leaving us this week is...

1017
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,480
..Rav.

1018
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,960
- Yeah.
- Just, I want to lean into you and then never leave.

1019
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,440
- I'll miss your face, Rav. 
- I'm going to miss you all, too.

1020
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,080
I'm really, really proud of myself

1021
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,960
and I'm glad that I've made it this far.

1022
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
Week six, I mean, that's an achievement for me.

1023
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,600
I'm leaving here with a smile on my face and I couldn't be happier.

1024
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,800
- Well done, Rav.
- Thank you. Thank you so much, Paul.

1025
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,280
Rav's a great baker, but I think, at the end of the day,

1026
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,520
Andrew did better than Rav in the Showstopper,

1027
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,400
and, unfortunately, Rav had to go.

1028
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,520
I can't believe it. I'm a lucky duck.

1029
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,440
I've got to really show them what I'm made of next week,

1030
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,960
and put awful botanicals behind us.

1031
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,680
Well done, Tom.

1032
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,640
Tom was a bit of a wild one, wasn't he, this week?

1033
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,240
He started really badly,

1034
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,920
but to get those flavours of the tea to come through

1035
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,240
at just the right level, proper Star Baker.

1036
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,200
You've pulled it right back.

1037
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,120
Now, carry that through into the next week.

1038
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,520
Tom surprised us all. He did brilliantly.

1039
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,920
Yes, yes, yes!

1040
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,360
I am very surprised.

1041
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,360
Not a brilliant first day, and to come back and be Star Baker,

1042
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,040
it makes me feel like I'm supposed to be here.

1043
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,240
Next time, it's desserts.

1044
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,800
This is week seven of Bake Off.

1045
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,120
Good enough is not good enough any more.

1046
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,640
As we roll out...

1047
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,120
Damn it. Damn it!

1048
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,040
..a cracking signature...

1049
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,560
Oh, it's cracked. It's cracked.

1050
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,400
A technical that's driving the bakers nuts...

1051
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,120
It's just crystallised.

1052
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,520
Start again.

1053
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,760
Argh!

1054
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,640
..and a mini Showstopper...

1055
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,080
They're going to collapse.

1056
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,240
..with massive expectations.

1057
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,920
They are just sliding everywhere.

1058
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,160
- Oh, no.
- Will you ever ride a big dipper again after this, Andrew?

1059
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,440
- Probably not.
- OK. Good man.
