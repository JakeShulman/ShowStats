7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,599
BOTH: Welcome to The
Great British Bake Off.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,899
Last time, Bread Week got emotional.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,599
MARY: It is SO big. To try and get
that done in two-and-a-half hours

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,599
is quite difficult.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,599
The youngest baker, Michael...
It is a mess.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
You didn't glaze it,

13
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:33,599
you didn't get the rise and we
haven't got the definition.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,599
..was the third to leave the tent.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,599
And although Andrew tried his best...

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,599
I love that.

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
..Tom's rise continued...

18
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:43,599
The plaiting is excellent. I think
you have done a very good job.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,599
Thank you... winning Star
Baker for the first time.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,599
APPLAUSE Well done, Tom!

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,599
Well done, Tom.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,599
This time, the bakers
battle a Bake Off first...

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,599
Holy moley.

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,599
..batter.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,599
There is an unpredictable
Sunday lunch Signature...

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,599
How can Yorkshires make
you feel so nervous?

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,599
They are not going to allow me
into Yorkshire, ever again.

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,599
..the most artistic Technical Bake yet...

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,599
Lace, lace, lace, lace, lace...
Not even got any lace pants.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,599
Only going to get one chance at this.

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,599
..and a Showstopper where the
bakers jump from the frying pan...

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
into the fryer.

33
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,599
I think this is pretty tricky for them.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,599
It is a bit tense at the moment.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,599
Getting to the rushing stage now.
Really behind.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,599
Come on, come on.

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Ohhhh!

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
That... tastes... UNBELIEVABLE.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
BIRDSONG

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,599
We have had cakes, we've had
biscuits, we've had bread.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Now, this week, time for a store
cupboard special. It's batter.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,599
She's brought the cricket bat, hasn't she?

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,599
Your e-mail was very unclear!
Eggs, flour, milk.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,599
I bought little weird shin
pads, and that box thing!

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,599
Nothing to do with cricket.

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
It's Batter Week.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,599
It's not really sunk in yet that
I was Star Baker last week.

48
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,599
I am feeling a little bit
like I have to live up to it.

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,599
Whether I will, who knows?
But that's the sense.

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,599
This week, it's concentrating
on the fundamentals.

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,599
So, time management, not raw, not burnt.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,599
It is a bit weird, batter, but I
have a good feeling about this week.

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I've been saying all week,
"Let's get battered!"

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,599
Bakers, welcome to a first in
The Great British Bake Off.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,599
Batter! Ooh! We're doing batter!

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,599
Now, Paul and Mary would like you to
make Yorkshire puddings. 24 of them.

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,599
"Easy", you think. But... hold fire. What?

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,599
These Yorkshire puddings
have got to be identical.

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,599
You will need to focus mind over batter.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,599
The batter can be flavoured
any which way you like,

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,599
and the Yorkshire puddings
need a savoury filling.

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,599
OK, you have got two hours
to produce your puddings.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
On your marks... Get yourself set!
BOTH: Bake!

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I am a big fan of Yorkshire puddings.

65
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,599
I'm feeling quite happy about this bake.

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,599
Batter week, the one that I
have been dreading the most.

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,599
We are looking for top-grade
Yorkshire pudding.

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,599
Well risen, they should sort of curl
up, turning in a bit at the top,

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,599
and then a lovely dip to take a filling.

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,599
To get Yorkshire puddings all
identical, it is very tricky.

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,599
Once it's in the oven, it
is in the lap of the gods.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,599
The whole rising of the Yorkshire
pudding comes from the egg.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,599
You can add ingredients to it,

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,599
but the more things you add to
the mixture, the denser it gets,

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,599
the harder it is to rise.
We want to see uniformity.

76
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,599
We want to see finesse.

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,599
And at the end of the
day, this is Bake Off,

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
it's got to taste amazing.

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,599
Notoriously fickle to perfect,
we have all got a different

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,599
family recipe for Yorkshire puddings,

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,599
and our bakers are no exception.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,599
I use eight eggs, and however
much the eight eggs weigh,

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,599
is how much flour and milk I put in.

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,599
I put four eggs in for about 250g of flour.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,599
Seems to be a lot of debate in
the Yorkshire pudding community

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,599
about how much rise that gives you.

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,599
The batter will be fairly thin. I
want them really light and crispy.

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
No soggy bottom in these Yorkshires.

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,599
Morning, Val. Morning, Paul. Morning, Mary.

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,599
You're from Yorkshire, Yorkshire
puddings should be a doddle for you.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,599
My husband said, "If you fail on this one,

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,599
"we will never live this down."

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,599
Val, this is in your blood, isn't it?

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,599
It is a Yorkshire pudding
batter I have made for years,

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
my mum taught me.

96
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,599
Her mum's Yorkshire pudding
recipe uses five eggs.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,599
But Val is leaving the Dales
behind her by filling them

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,599
with a spicy, Mexican-inspired chilli.

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,599
It is quite a hot chilli.

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,599
I need the simpleness of
the Yorkshire puddings

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,599
to counterbalance the chilli.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,599
Are they going to be the best
Yorkshires that you have ever made?

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Hopefully. Good luck.

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,599
I'm feeling OK about this challenge.

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,599
I love Yorkshire puddings and love steaks.

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,599
Really, there was only one
thing I was going to do.

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,599
Deconstructed beef Wellington.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,599
Like the classic, Candice is
using best fillet and mushrooms.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,599
She is serving her filled puds
with a horseradish cream,

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,599
and, for good measure,

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,599
adding grated horseradish to her batter.

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,599
I just want things to work
this week and be spot-on.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,599
Erm...

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I didn't want to use that one anyway.

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,599
I wanted to take Yorkshire on holiday.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,599
It is quite a traditional
actual batter mix,

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,599
and then I am putting a Spanish
chicken filling on the inside.

118
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,599
So, yeah, Yorkshire goes on tour.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,599
Andrew's tapas puddings will be
packed with chunks of spiced chicken

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
in a tomato and saffron sauce,

121
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,599
then topped with toasted almonds.

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,599
The only thing I have added
really to the traditional

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Yorkshire mix is mustard powder.

124
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,599
Gives it a bit more of a yellow-ey
colour, bit more inviting.

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,599
I've a friend who is from
Yorkshire who tipped me off

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
that that was how her
mum used to make them.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,599
To get 24 identical puds,

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,599
the bakers are free to make
as much batter as they like,

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,599
but they must get the
consistency of their mix right.

130
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,599
Too thick and the puddings won't rise.

131
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,599
Too runny and they won't
hold their structure.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,599
I think there are all sorts
of different recipes.

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,599
Believe me, I have tried them all.
None of them seem to work for me!

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,599
Good morning, Jane. Good morning.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,599
Right, Yorkshire puddings,
what are you going to do?

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,599
I can't make Yorkshires to save my life.
Jane, don't say this.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,599
My mother could never understand why
I couldn't make Yorkshire puddings.

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
What's the problem with
the Yorkshires normally?

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
They are so misshapen,

140
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,599
and I get the hole underneath
rather than in the top.

141
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,599
Undeterred, Jane is pairing her Yorkshires

142
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,599
with a Sunday roast and
all of the trimmings.

143
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,599
Inside each pud, a pea puree
will be topped with beef,

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,599
crispy potatoes and a horseradish cream.

145
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,599
My husband and my son love roast dinner,

146
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
so I'm just trying to capture
the essence of that, really.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,599
Good morning, Rav. Hi.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,599
It's smelling a bit spicy here,
tell us about your batter.

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I have added some smoked paprika,

150
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,599
some cumin and a little bit of red chilli.

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,599
Right, it's becoming less
Yorkshire by the moment.

152
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
MEL: Yorkshire with a twist, though.

153
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,599
Yeah, it's a bit of a fusion
Yorkshire pudding. Lovely.

154
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,599
Rav's going all-out with
his Asian-style puddings,

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,599
accompanying them with
an aromatic tofu curry

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
garnished with Thai basil.

157
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:36,599
Has this got coconut milk in there?
It does, yeah.

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,599
Has this got lime in there?

159
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,599
A little bit, yeah. Every single challenge!
Paul, it's his signature.

160
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,599
Can I be honest with you? Yeah, go on.
I love coconut, I love lime...

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,599
Do you like tofu?

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
RAV LAUGHS

163
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm not a massive fan of tofu. OK.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,599
Yorkshire puddings make
me think of Sunday lunch.

165
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,599
And Sunday lunch at my house,
cos we were all vegetarians,

166
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,599
was going to the local Indian
restaurant and eating it there.

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,599
So we always used to have aloo gobi.
That was what I had.

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,599
Inspired by those culinary forays,

169
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,599
Tom is filling his puds with a
cauliflower and potato curry.

170
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,599
And, for an additional Indian kick,

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
he's added nigella seeds

172
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
to his batter,

173
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,599
and is using unconventional flour.

174
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,599
My Yorkshire pudding has some
chickpea flour, or chana flour.

175
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,599
Obviously it alters the structure
of the Yorkshire pudding.

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,599
Yeah, I think it makes the Yorkshire
a bit lighter, a bit crispier around

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,599
the top. You still get the
classic Yorkshire texture,

178
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
but it is just a bit
lighter than it would be.

179
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,600
Very different. Thank you, Tom.

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,599
I'm leaving my batter
just to rest for a while.

181
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
When I've been testing it,

182
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,599
resting it seems to give
a slightly better rise.

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,599
I need to leave it for about half an hour.

184
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm just going to put my
batter into the fridge.

185
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Our bakers can now turn their
attention to their fillings.

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Do I use a half or a whole one?

187
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,600
I don't want to blow Paul and
Mary's head off with it!

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,599
I'm just dicing my tofu, which is
going to go into my Thai curry.

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,599
But tofu is very bland, so you
do need to add a lot of flavour,

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,599
and that curry paste there

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,599
has definitely got a lot of flavour.
I just tried it.

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,599
My curry paste is coriander, chilli,
ginger, shallots, garlic and salt.

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,599
I'm smelling some wonderful things

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,599
from other bakers who
are also doing curries.

195
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,599
Maybe there is a little bit of a
Great British Curry Off going on.

196
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,599
Hello, Selasi. Tell us all
about your Yorkshire puds.

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,599
I'm making Yorkshire puddings
filled with pork tenderloin

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
and pork crackling.

199
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,599
Wow. Pork... Pork crackling?

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,599
How big are these things going to be?

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,599
Just standard size, standard
muffin tin size. I love crackling.

202
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I think this is the first time

203
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,599
we've ever had crackling on Bake Off.
Awesome.

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,599
Selasi's crackling will
be the crowning glory

205
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,599
on each of his filled Yorkshires.

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,599
He's roasting his pork with cider

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
and herbs then serving each

208
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,599
pud with apple sauce.

209
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Looks good, looks good.

210
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,599
The filling recipe was passed
down from my girlfriend's mum.

211
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,599
It's her very own recipe, so
she will be really proud.

212
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,599
I have to nail it, basically.

213
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,599
My batter is in the fridge. I
have got my turkey in the oven.

214
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,599
At the moment, I'm just
making the stuffing.

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,599
My Yorkshire puddings are my

216
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,599
Christmas dinner compromise
Yorkshire puddings.

217
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,599
My husband and I both had very
similar upbringings, but the

218
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,599
one thing we differ on is
that his family always had

219
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,599
Yorkshire puddings on Christmas Day,
and our family never, ever did,

220
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,599
so in the interest of marital harmony,

221
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,599
I am making him Christmas
dinner Yorkshire puddings.

222
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,599
Kate's festive filling is
as Christmassy as it gets.

223
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,599
Her turkey will be wrapped with
a sausage meat stuffing served

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
with a cranberry and bread sauce.

225
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,600
So it is Christmas dinner
in a Yorkshire pudding.

226
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,599
Hello, Benjamina. Hello.
MEL: Hey, Benjamina.

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,599
Tell us all about your Yorkshire puddings.

228
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,599
So my Yorkshires are going to be filled

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,599
with a red onion and bacon
chutney/jam type thing,

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,599
and some brie, and some
crispy bacon on top.

231
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,599
Ooh, lovely, nice combination!

232
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,599
Benjamina has kept it relatively
simple with her classic trio,

233
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
but she's pepped up her

234
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:59,599
pudding batter with some herbs

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
and a bit of mustard.

236
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I just like the flavours.

237
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,599
I'd normally have this
in a sandwich, really.

238
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Batter the devil you know.

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,599
It's Spanish-influenced chicken.

240
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,599
It's actually quite sweet, a
mouthful of it is enough.

241
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,599
There we go, nice little spirals of potato.

242
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,599
And then I'm partially frying it
and forcing it into these tins.

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,599
They just brown really nicely in the oven.

244
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,599
At this rate we're just going
to have Christmas dinner

245
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,599
and no Yorkshire puddings, cos I
haven't even got them in the oven yet.

246
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
We'll get some puddings in,

247
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,600
and then I'll feel better.
Just going to get the batter.

248
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,599
There's a pud in the
hood and it smells good!

249
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
You've got 45 minutes, bakers.

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,599
For Yorkshires to rise,
you need really hot oil.

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,599
Like, smoking hot oil.

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,599
I'm using sunflower oil just cos
it has a high smoking point.

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,599
I've got dripping. It's tradition.

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,599
If you're going to have Yorkshire puddings,

255
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,599
you serve it with beef dripping.

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,599
My oil has been heating in the
oven for just under ten minutes.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,599
The bit that's probably the most key
is pouring it into the hot oil.

258
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,599
CANDICE SNIGGERS

259
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,599
Oh, too much.

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,599
I'm using a ladle to put my
batter into my pudding dishes

261
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,599
because I want them to
all be the same size.

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,599
I want to make little cups
rather than big, puffy

263
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Yorkshire puddings, so I'm trying
to be fairly accurate about it.

264
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,599
Oh! It's so hard to get Yorkshire
puddings to be uniform in shape.

265
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,599
Never been a concern of mine. Has it not?
But you're right.

266
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,599
I've been sweating the small stuff.
Yeah? Batter is where it's at.

267
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,599
Now, listen, those aren't
smoking, can I just say?

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Should they not be smoking?

269
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,599
They haven't necessarily done that at home.

270
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,599
You've got the old chickpea batter
going in. It's all over the shop!

271
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,599
(Mate, you were Star Baker last week.)

272
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,599
Come on, you've got to
raise your game, my love.

273
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,599
Just going to pop these in the oven.

274
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,599
My oven was heated to 225,

275
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,599
but I'm actually going to
reduce the heat now, to 200.

276
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,599
I'm going for 15 minutes on 230.

277
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
MEL: A hot oven and hot fat

278
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,599
ensure the batter starts
to cook immediately,

279
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,599
creating the steam needed to form
air pockets and the perfect rise.

280
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Hopefully.

281
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,599
SHE MIMICS PUDDINGS RISING

282
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
This is really hard.

283
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:07,599
You want to keep it all as hot as possible,

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,599
I've got to try and get as
close to the oven as...

285
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
SHE SIGHS

286
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,599
Do you know, I actually like to watch them.

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,599
I will stand there watching
them rise, so I'm going to

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,599
chill out for a minute and sit
down and watch me Yorkshires rise.

289
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
She says hopefully!

290
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
It's in the lap of the gods now.

291
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,599
Not going to open it until the time's up

292
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,599
because I don't want them to deflate.

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,599
They don't look as though
they're rising properly.

294
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,599
Oh, I feel really nervous now!

295
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,599
They're humongous!

296
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,599
Definitely not 24 even Yorkshires,
but the smaller ones are

297
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,599
for the kids, and then the
bigger ones are for the adults.

298
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm sticking to it, that's my story.

299
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,599
They look OK, they look OK.

300
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Good God!

301
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,600
SUE GASPS

302
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,599
Yeah, I am down with that.
Look at the puff on that.

303
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,599
These are rubbish. The oven wasn't
hot enough. They've gone flat.

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,599
And the bottom ones have
hardly risen at all.

305
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,599
They're not going to allow me
into Yorkshire, ever again.

306
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,599
I've got Yorkshire biscuits!

307
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Bit flat. First ones never
come out right anyway.

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,599
So they're my practice ones
to get my tin warmed up.

309
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,599
They're not bad, but they're not perfect.

310
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,599
They've all got the same amount of batter,

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,599
but some of them have risen
slightly differently to others.

312
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,599
Don't look at these. These are not
the Yorkshires you are looking for.

313
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,599
They are an absolute disaster.
Maybe they weren't hot enough.

314
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,599
I have no idea.

315
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,599
OK. They have closed up
a bit in the middle.

316
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,599
They are crispy on the
bottom, which is good.

317
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,599
Oh, they look beautiful! Would you
like to compare them to mine?

318
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Which would you rather eat? Oh, dear.

319
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,599
I had it at 220, which is
what I've had it at home.

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,599
No problem, puffed up. But
it just hasn't worked here.

321
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
They're going in the bin.

322
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,599
Tom, all the colour and
life has drained from you.

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,599
Tom, don't be down.

324
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
HE MAKES CRACKING NOISE

325
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,599
It's all right, we'll get there.

326
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,599
OK, I'm going to turn the oven up a bit

327
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,599
and do another couple of batches.

328
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,599
I'm going to start again.

329
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,599
I'm wondering if it's about
how hot the oven is.

330
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,599
Start again. But with a hotter oven.

331
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I've really got to get this in now.

332
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,599
Bakers, you've got half an hour
left on your Yorkshire challenge,

333
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,599
half an hour.

334
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
SHE WHIMPERS

335
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,599
How can Yorkshires make
you feel so nervous?

336
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,599
This is the second batch of batter,
and doing exactly the same thing.

337
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,599
They have not risen at all.
They are just pancakes.

338
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
What could it be? What have I done wrong?

339
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,599
Is it different flour? Rubbish.

340
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,599
I've never had a flat Yorkshire before.

341
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,599
Some of them are OK, some of
them are a little bit stupid.

342
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,599
These ones are quite nice.

343
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,599
Well, they're better, they're better.
Oh, well.

344
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,599
They're not as good as I want them
to be, but I'll fill these ones.

345
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,599
OK, bakers, if you could
finish in ten minutes,

346
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,599
it would be BATTER for all of us.

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,599
Ten minutes, bakers.

348
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,599
Just need to get plated up, really.

349
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,599
Oh, dear. Right, OK.

350
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
This is a mad moment now.

351
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:23,599
I'm not going to not serve something,

352
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,599
so I will start filling them.
Not that this will work,

353
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,599
because there is nothing
to hold the stuff in!

354
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,599
This one is my favourite. It
has a nice hole in the middle.

355
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Plenty of space for the filling.

356
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,599
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

357
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,599
This is my pea puree.

358
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,599
I'm hoping if I put enough
in, they will not notice.

359
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,599
How much longer have we got left?

360
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,599
OK, bakers, five minutes
left, and don't throw them -

361
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
that's battery.

362
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
My hands are shaking, I can
hardly get the little leaf on.

363
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,599
How many minutes? How many minutes?
How many minutes?

364
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
We've got three minutes, Candice.

365
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,599
YORKSHIRE ACCENT: Right, you lot,

366
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
time's up, time's up on your Yorkshires.

367
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Bakes at the end of the
benches, gang, please.

368
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,599
They look fairly uniform.

369
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,599
They are well risen, they've got

370
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,599
the same amount of filling in each one.

371
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,599
Good colour, I like the way
you've toasted your nuts.

372
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,599
So, great consistency inside that as well.

373
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,599
I like to see some irregular
air pockets in there,

374
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
and you have got that.

375
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,599
Well baked. The flavours you got
in the chicken are coming through.

376
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,599
I love the sultanas in there,
I like the fruitiness of it.

377
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,599
Yeah, I like that, I like that a lot.

378
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I think you've done very well, Andrew.

379
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,599
They're a bit irregular,
and they look quite small.

380
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,599
We're not getting enough rise in
that Yorkshire pudding, are we?

381
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,599
Right, let's go with this fella here.

382
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,599
Tastes just like Christmas dinner to me.

383
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
The flavours are lovely,

384
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,599
but I don't think you put
enough batter in there

385
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,599
to give us the size that we wanted.

386
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
The Yorkshires are just too small.

387
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,599
They look most exciting. Thank you!

388
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,599
I love the idea of your spiralised roastie.

389
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,599
But to go to the Yorkshire pudding,
we have got them different sizes.

390
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
And we haven't got a great rise.

391
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,599
It's a little bit dense in there,

392
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
they needed a little bit longer
in the oven unfortunately.

393
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,599
That... tastes... UNBELIEVABLE.

394
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,599
Yum! That is delicious. Thank you.

395
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,599
But it was a Yorkshire pudding challenge,

396
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
and that's what's let you down.

397
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,599
They're too flat. Yeah.

398
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
There's not much life in there, very thin.

399
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,599
You could do with a little bit more
seasoning in there, for me. OK.

400
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,599
I think, overall, your Yorkshire
puddings were all right.

401
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,599
I do think they could be a bit wetter,

402
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,599
which would allow them to
grow a little bit more.

403
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,599
The flavour is unbelievably beautiful.

404
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,599
It is, the beef together
with the flavours you've got

405
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,599
in there as well, it is beautiful.

406
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It is good. Thank you very much.

407
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,599
Nice colour. I mean, they could
go a little bit browner.

408
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
They're quite cute, they're dainty,

409
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:40,600
but you have differences in size there.

410
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,599
The flavour is very good.
It's a little soft.

411
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,599
Great texture inside that. Quite
big air pockets in there.

412
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,599
I think it needed just a couple
more minutes in the oven,

413
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
but your flavours are excellent. Thank you.

414
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,599
Straight away, as soon
as the knife goes in,

415
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,599
you know it's going to be a good Yorkshire.

416
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,599
The bake is beautiful,
it's fluffy, it's light...

417
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
And there's masses of room to
put all that pork filling in.

418
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,599
Just got the sound of his jaws.

419
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,599
The tectonic plates of the earth in my ear.

420
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,599
The crackling is beautiful.

421
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,599
The only problem we've got is
we've got a little chap here,

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,599
and we've got a whopping one here.

423
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,599
Want some more crackling?
I've got more here.

424
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,599
Whatever Mary says, fantastic!

425
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,599
MOUTH FULL: Those taste amazing. Thank you.

426
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,599
That crackling is spot-on. Thank you.
Thanks, Solasi, that's lovely.

427
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
MUNCHING CONTINUES

428
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,599
You've got tofu in this, haven't you?

429
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,599
Come on, Paul, you can do it, come on.

430
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
You've got it well filled here.

431
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,600
Great texture of the Yorkshire pudding.
Beautiful.

432
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Mm. It is quite different, and
it is spicy, and it's good.

433
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,599
I would have another one of them.
Oh, my God.

434
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
If you hadn't told me it was tofu...

435
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,599
Paul in tofu shocker.

436
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,599
The flavours again, the spice
combinations are fantastic.

437
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
All round, they're good Yorkshire puddings.
Thanks, Rav. Thanks.

438
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,599
OK, what you've actually
got here are 24 blinis

439
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
with some rice on the top.

440
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
The topping is a good flavour.

441
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:22,600
The actual Yorkshire pudding is
dry, it's solid, it's well-baked.

442
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
It's like a biscuit. Mmm.

443
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:29,599
I'm not surprised that it
didn't rise using chickpeas

444
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,599
and nigella seeds, because it's a
very heavy flour to get going.

445
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
However many eggs you put in it.

446
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,599
They do vary in size. Some of
them are thick, some are thin.

447
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,599
Good colour. It's light,
it has got a good colour.

448
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
It's a proper Yorkshire pudding. Mmm.

449
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,599
The actual Yorkshire pudding itself
is a beautiful texture. Thank you.

450
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,599
The filling, as well, I like, it's
got a nice bit of kick to it,

451
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,599
nice bit of heat, and the two
together, it does work. Thank you!

452
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Made Yorkshire proud. Thank you.

453
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I can now go back into Yorkshire.

454
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:12,599
I don't think it could have
gone much better, to be fair.

455
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,599
That was bang-on what I
was hoping it would be.

456
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,599
I knew they weren't as
perfect as they could be.

457
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,599
In hindsight, wish I'd put a bit more
batter in and gone a bit bigger.

458
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,599
I'd love to be able to say I'm
going to put this one out of

459
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,599
my mind and just get on with
it, but that'd be a total lie.

460
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm definitely going to fixate on
this for at least a few hours!

461
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,599
The Batter Technical is another
Bake Off first, and, as ever,

462
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
it's a total mystery.

463
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,599
OK, bakers, welcome to your
Technical Challenge, which,

464
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,599
this week, Paul has set for you.

465
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,599
It's going to be judged blind,

466
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,599
but we would like a word of
advice before you depart.

467
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,599
Practise your pattern
before you use the mixture.

468
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,599
Ohh... Cryptic. Enigmatic Hollywood.

469
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,599
Mm. Tatty byes.

470
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,599
Farewell to Hollywood.

471
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,599
Now, for your Technical Challenge,
Paul's brief is lacy pancakes.

472
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,599
He'd like you to make 12
heart-shaped lace pancakes.

473
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,599
They should be intricate and beautiful,

474
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,599
like a doily you might find in
Carole Middleton's guest bedroom.

475
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,599
Mmm. You are allowed to
make one test pancake.

476
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,599
The other 12 that come after it must
be presented. You've got one hour.

477
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
On your marks... get set... BOTH: ..bake.

478
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,599
What is a lace pancake? I
have not got the foggiest.

479
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,599
Lace pancakes were traditionally
eaten by the rich

480
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
at their show-off dinners.

481
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,599
They first appeared in one
of the earliest cookbooks

482
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,599
ever printed - 1615's The English Huswife.

483
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,599
I am slightly flummoxed by the whole thing.

484
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,599
The instructions are very, very minimal.

485
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,599
Are you ready for this complex recipe?

486
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,599
"Make a pancake batter." That's it.

487
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,599
Work it out, go. This could
be a heartbreaking challenge.

488
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,599
Kind of wish I'd made
pancakes more recently.

489
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,599
Paul, why did you choose lacy pancakes?

490
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,599
I like the idea of pancakes. I think
a good pancake is a thing of beauty.

491
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
We've taken it to the next level, really.

492
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,599
Making it into a lace design
is all about intricacy,

493
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,599
it's about delicacy and it's about skill.

494
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,599
You serve that with ice
cream, I'd have that any day.

495
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,599
It melts in the mouth, you've got
a beautiful pancake flavour.

496
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,599
They've got to get the consistency
of the batter absolutely perfect.

497
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,599
You can't have the batter too thick,

498
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,599
the whole thing will become quite
stringy rather than pancake-like.

499
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,599
If it's too thin, then it
will just all mould together.

500
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,599
Now, the mystery ingredient, to
them, I'm sure will be the sugar.

501
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,599
You're suggesting they put a little
sugar in to help with the colouring.

502
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,599
Yeah, I put sugar in deliberately.

503
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,599
Because it's a lace design, you
want it to colour quite quickly.

504
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,599
The longer it sits there,
the more it dries it out,

505
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,599
because it hasn't got the
full surface area of

506
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,599
a conventional pancake, which is
why you have to be really quick,

507
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,599
and intricate, and delicate,

508
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,599
and make it look good, AND do it 12 times.

509
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,599
Very difficult indeed. I think
it's a great challenge.

510
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,599
I make pancakes a lot at home and
I should be able to do them in

511
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,599
my sleep, but you're going, "How much milk?
Is it half a pint?"

512
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,599
It's amazing how your mind
goes completely blank.

513
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,599
It just gives us the basic ingredients,

514
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
no measurements or amounts.

515
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,599
My brain's gone a bit to mush
as to what the ratio is,

516
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,599
so I'm just going to
have to go for gut feel.

517
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,599
I've put 10oz of flour in, six eggs
and a couple of ounces of sugar.

518
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,599
Sugar, sugar. A couple
of tablespoons of sugar.

519
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,599
I'm actually worried about the
sugar but when I'm making pancakes

520
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,599
I very rarely put sugar in them.
I've done three tablespoons so far.

521
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,599
When it hits the pan the
sugar's going to caramelise,

522
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,599
so it makes it cook slightly differently.

523
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,599
I have used all of the sugar.
I don't know if that's right.

524
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,599
I honestly have no idea!

525
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,599
My batter is normally like single
cream, that kind of thickness,

526
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
so that's what I'm going for.

527
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,599
If you're doing a heart it's
got to stand up in the pan

528
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,599
rather than spread too much, so
I'm going for slightly thicker.

529
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,599
You've got to have that baker's intuition.

530
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,599
Sometimes you just have to look at
it and say, "It looks about right."

531
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
It looks OK to me.

532
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:12,599
I don't know, maybe it should
have been a bit thicker,

533
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
cos it needs to hold its shape.

534
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,599
I'm going to try and draw
meself a template for a heart.

535
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,599
Might draw it out first
on a piece of paper.

536
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Lace, lace, lace, lace, lace.

537
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,599
I've no idea what the lace
scene is meant to look like.

538
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,599
This is my plan for my heart shape.
Very detailed, as you can see.

539
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,599
What's going on here, Selasi? I
don't know what I was think...

540
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,599
I'm not good at drawing, I'm terrible!

541
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,599
This is excellent, that's just
a pair of buttocks, isn't it?

542
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's very, very
good, with no lace at all. Yeah!

543
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,599
What does lace look like?

544
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,599
Do they want lovely lace or
do they want squiggly lace?

545
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,599
I've not even got any lace pants.

546
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,599
It just says, "Pipe 12
heart-shaped lace pancakes.

547
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,599
"Serve 12 apart from your one tester."

548
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,599
Do you know what I haven't done?

549
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,599
Paul said practise the piping before
you did it, so I'm going to do that.

550
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,599
This is my way of practising without
it officially being a test.

551
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,599
Other people are doing it onto
baking sheets and I'm thinking,

552
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,599
no, I'm going to free-form it.

553
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,599
I'm just going to try and
practise one, see how it cooks.

554
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,599
Only going to get one chance at this. OK...

555
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,599
Paul's recipe doesn't state what temperature
the batter should be cooked at.

556
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,599
I've gone for a medium heat.

557
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,599
I'm going for a reasonably high heat.

558
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,599
I've got this on a very hot heat
and I'm now thinking that was

559
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,599
a bad idea. Cos I think that has burned.
Yes, it has.

560
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,599
That was me tester. Now we
know, a little bit cooler.

561
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,599
The trouble is, the middle's going to be
cooked when the outside's still cooking,

562
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,599
so I think we're just going to
keep it as simple as we can.

563
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,599
That's definitely not a heart.

564
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,599
It's slightly the same as
what I practised on paper.

565
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,599
The fact that this is my
only test is a bit scary,

566
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,599
because this looks awful!

567
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,599
I think this might be the
worst thing I've ever made.

568
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
It needs more definition.

569
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,600
It's a heart-shaped pancake.

570
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,599
I'm not sure who would wear it.
I mean, that's lace, right?

571
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,599
Oh, dear, my practice has not
come out looking very delicate.

572
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,599
I just think I'm going for totally
the wrong thing, it feels wrong.

573
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
I'm not going to do this pattern.

574
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:16,599
My test pancake, the batter's really thin,
so it's spreading more than I'd like.

575
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,599
I've just put a drop more flour
in, so, tested, re-evaluated,

576
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
going again.

577
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
That doesn't look too bad.

578
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,599
I've just got to remember
the design and do it again.

579
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
The bakers' next 12 pancakes must
all be presented to Paul and Mary.

580
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,599
I just want to get 12 out looking
OK, looking roughly the same.

581
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
It's quite hard piping
freehand into a frying pan.

582
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
This is my first actual one,

583
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:45,599
so whatever this one comes out
like we're going to copy this.

584
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,599
I don't know how to get them all the
same shape! This is number two.

585
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,599
It's a little browner than I
would have liked but it's OK

586
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,599
and it's heart-shaped and it's pretty lacy.

587
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,599
I'm quite happy with how they look.
They're all fairly similar-looking.

588
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,599
It's on a medium heat. I
don't want it to burn,

589
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,599
but then I think this is taking
me way too long just to do one.

590
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Bakers, you've got half an hour left.

591
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,599
Going to have to really up my pace. Whoops.

592
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,599
Oh, this is chaotic.

593
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,599
Really, this is one of the most
difficult things yet, I think.

594
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Ahh! Blast!

595
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,599
Nice shape, nice pattern, nice colour.
Broken.

596
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,599
I'm going for shabby-chic
pancakes rather than delicacies.

597
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Oh, my life.

598
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:29,599
Come on, come on, bit
faster, cook a bit faster.

599
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
There's time, there's time. Ooh!

600
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,599
That was my tester, so not
to panic, not to panic!

601
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,599
Do you know what? I love pancakes.
Are you a tosser or a flipper?

602
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,599
Ah, a tosser all the way, Mel. Tosser?
Good, just checking. Thank you.

603
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm not flipping this for anybody.
I'm not going to risk it.

604
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey!

605
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,599
This one smells burnt.

606
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,599
Slightly overdone. The tester
was much better than this one.

607
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
I wish that didn't fall on the floor now.

608
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,599
So, I'm very behind. You've got 13 minutes.

609
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,599
I have 13 minutes left
and I've done five now.

610
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
OK!

611
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,599
Ooh, that one's going at the bottom!

612
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,599
One lovely flick of the
wrist, over it comes.

613
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,599
(Colour's good, though. Colour's
good, isn't it? I don't know.)

614
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,599
Well, no-one knows. No-one knows what goes
through Paul's mind. No-one's seen these.

615
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,599
I think I'm quite happy with them.
Golden brown.

616
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,599
You've got 11 minutes left. 11. All right.

617
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,599
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

618
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,599
Nine, ten. Two more after this one.

619
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,599
The design's kind of evolving with time,

620
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,599
like any good artist's style does.
There's three more to do.

621
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,599
This is the last one. But
they're very Jackson Pollock!

622
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
SHE LAUGHS

623
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,599
They're not all uniform in shape.
They are what they are.

624
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,599
Bakers, you've got five minutes.
Five minutes!

625
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,599
Nine, ten, 11.

626
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Gosh. They're terrible.

627
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,599
For better or for worse, they're done.

628
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Ooh, sugar.

629
00:30:57,601 --> 00:31:00,599
I see other people putting sugar on it.
But I'm not going to.

630
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,599
I'm going to give them a bit of a dusting,
bit of a last-minute flavour injection.

631
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I think that's 12.

632
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,599
Congratulations, guys. Time is up.

633
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,599
You all did brilliantly, not
a heart failure in sight.

634
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,599
If you'd like to bring your
beautiful lacy batters

635
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,599
and pop them behind the photo of
yourself on the gingham altar.

636
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,599
Well done, gang.

637
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,599
Mary and Paul have no idea

638
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
which plate of pancakes
belongs to which baker.

639
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,599
Right, what we're looking for is
12 delicately laced pancakes.

640
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,599
So, we'll start over here.

641
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,599
Now, these look very good indeed.
Nice colour.

642
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,599
They're holding together well,
they're following the same pattern.

643
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,599
They taste sweet to me. Yep, pretty good.

644
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,599
Right, moving on to these little fellas.

645
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,599
There's a little bit of lace in there.

646
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,599
Looks like an alien's face in the middle.

647
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,599
There's some pale and some
quite dark, aren't there?

648
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,599
Not as sweet as the first one.
Right, moving on.

649
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,599
Here we have similar patterns...

650
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,599
It's a little on the clumsy side.

651
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,599
I'd prefer it a little bit finer.

652
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,599
That one's quite dark,
that one's quite light.

653
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,599
Some of them are overcooked,
some of them aren't.

654
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,599
There's no sweetness there.
Not much sweetness, no.

655
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,599
Now, these are a whole plethora of colours,

656
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,599
and they're bone dry, too, overdone.

657
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
There's too much sugar
and they overcooked it.

658
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,599
Biscuits.

659
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,599
So we move on, then. These are
quite delicately coloured.

660
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,599
All of them are the same.
Interesting pattern.

661
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,599
It's not bad, the pattern.

662
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,599
That's fine, it's moist.

663
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,599
Now, these look highly elaborate.
They're very nice, aren't they?

664
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,599
Yeah. They look like table mats.

665
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,599
That must be quite a
difficult design to do.

666
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,599
They're very attractive.

667
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,599
To cook them on the frying pan would
have been quite tricky. Very nice.

668
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,599
Very good. Right, these are
quite an equal colour.

669
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,599
They are very delicate, though.
Nice decoration, which is nice.

670
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,599
They're beautifully moist,
they're not dry in any way.

671
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,599
Yeah, taste is good. Moving on.

672
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,599
Now, this one looks quite fat.

673
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,599
There's a bit of a difference in colour.

674
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,599
That's really pale, that one's really dark.

675
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,599
They're not so delicate, are they?

676
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,599
Again, it's lucky it's got the
sugar on the outside to carry

677
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,599
that little bit of sweetness
through to the pancake. Last one.

678
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,599
Delicate. It's a very nice design.
One a little bit too baked here.

679
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Yeah, down the bottom they are.

680
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,599
Bit crispy, that one. That was a bit dry.

681
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,599
It's a nice design, that one, but a
bit inconsistent with the colour.

682
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,599
But which plate will be
judged pancake perfection?

683
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,599
In ninth place is this one. That's mine!

684
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,599
They're a little bit small
and more like waffles.

685
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
In eighth place, here.

686
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,599
These were a little bit simplistic
and a little on the thick side.

687
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,599
In seventh is this one.

688
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,599
Quite dark, a lot of these
are inconsistent in colour.

689
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,599
Very simple, more like
webbing than it is lace.

690
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,599
Val is sixth, Tom fifth
and Andrew is fourth.

691
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,599
In third place is this one here.
Pretty good, actually.

692
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,599
Quite a nice design, little
bit simplistic in the middle

693
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,599
but the addition on the outside
made all the difference. Well done.

694
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
And in second place...

695
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,599
A very pretty, light design.

696
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,599
And in first place is this one.

697
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Well done, Benjamina. Well done.

698
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,599
I did like the design on it. It
was very tight between these two.

699
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,599
I just found the design and
the flavour of this one just

700
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,599
pipped it, so well done.

701
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,599
Oh, I'm so happy. Finally
I've gone up there.

702
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,599
I think I've gone up and down in Technicals,
but it's good to get the number-one spot.

703
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,599
Really pleased with second, wasn't
expecting that at all. Well done.

704
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,599
I think fifth was fair enough.
Yeah, it was OK.

705
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,599
If it goes badly tomorrow I think
I'll be at risk of going home.

706
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,599
I'm a bit worried that I'm at the
bottom of the heap at the moment.

707
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,599
I think I've been
consistently inconsistent,

708
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,600
so we need to work on the consistency.

709
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,599
Paul, Mary, time for proper batter chatter.
Who did well so far?

710
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,599
Andrew, really, I would
think, did the best.

711
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,599
He had a lovely flavour on top
of his Yorkshire pudding, and in

712
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,599
the Technical he was fourth.

713
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,599
Benjamina, who won the Technical,
she's up there with Andrew.

714
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,599
I think you have to put
Candice in there as well.

715
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
She came second in the technical.

716
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:34,599
Showstopper this week is going to
be a potential banana skin for

717
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,599
a few people, including Kate and Tom.

718
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,599
His signature was not good.

719
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,599
We didn't get Yorkshire
pudding, we got blini.

720
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,599
And Kate didn't do particularly well
in the Yorkshire puddings, too.

721
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,599
What about Rav? He's really got
to step up into the Showstopper.

722
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,599
But if he has a bad day
he could be in trouble.

723
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,599
I can't bear the tension. It's always like this
at the beginning of Showstopper day, mate.

724
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,599
Am I going to have to get
the lawyer out again?

725
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Oh, sorry, I'm not allowed to touch you.
I've said, never touch. Sorry.

726
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,599
Welcome back, bakers, to Showstopper day,

727
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,599
or as they call it in Spain, la dia
de la fiesta panaderia sensacional,

728
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
or something like that.

729
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,599
Paul and Mary today would like you to make

730
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,599
a beautiful Spanish delicacy,

731
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
churros. Ohh!

732
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:18,599
36 of them, please.

733
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,599
Now, your churros should
be sweet, not savoury.

734
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,599
They can be filled, you
can use a dipping sauce,

735
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,599
you can make churros that are light
and fragrant or churros that

736
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,599
are hardy and suitable for battle
environments, like Chur-ross Kemp.

737
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,599
But the whole point is
they need to be identical.

738
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,599
You've got three hours, or tres horas. Si.

739
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,599
On your marks... Venga...

740
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Baaaaaake.

741
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,599
Batter, hot oil...

742
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,599
SHE SIGHS

743
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,599
The popular Spanish street food churros

744
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,599
are fried doughnut-like snacks,

745
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,599
traditionally served with a
thick chocolate dipping sauce.

746
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,599
I've never eaten one.

747
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Really, really wish I had.

748
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,599
I love churros.

749
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,599
What we're looking for is a
beautiful, brown, crispy exterior

750
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,599
with a lovely, soft interior.

751
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,599
But if they put too many in
the fryer at the same time

752
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,599
it drops the temperature of the oil
and they stay in there for too long

753
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,599
and it becomes quite an oily churros.

754
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
This is very tricky.

755
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,599
A simple street food has
got to be made into

756
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,599
a magnificent Showstopper.

757
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,599
I want them to think out of the box
and do something quite different.

758
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,599
Before this I'd never
actually made churros.

759
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,599
I'd eaten them, so I kind of knew
what they should taste and look like.

760
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,599
Yeah, feeling OK.

761
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,599
The bakers' first job
is to make the batter,

762
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,599
which is essentially a
type of choux pastry.

763
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,599
So I'm just melting down
my butter with water,

764
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
sugar and a little bit of salt.

765
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:48,599
When that's just bubbling you
tip all the flour in one go

766
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,599
and beat it up, a bit like
you do a choux paste.

767
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,599
The flour cooks and it
gets a nice, stiff dough.

768
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,599
I'm just making my first
set of churros batter.

769
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,599
I've gone for simple, crunchy Spanish
churros, so there's no eggs,

770
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
no butter.

771
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:03,599
It's flour, salt, sugar, water and oil.

772
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,599
But Andrew's final look is far from simple.

773
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,599
He's piping each churro into a flower shape

774
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,599
and serving them with an almond
liqueur ganache and a fruit puree.

775
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,599
It's going to have a cinnamon-sugar
stem and then a pistachio-dust

776
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,600
flower head, and I'm going
to serve it in a window box.

777
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,599
Unlike Andrew, most of the other
bakers are jazzing up their dough.

778
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,599
This is orange extract, just to
add a really nice hit of orange.

779
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,599
That is coconut extract. Really
bumping up the coconut here!

780
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,599
Every type of coconut is in this churro.
SHE GIGGLES

781
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
And, true to form,

782
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:40,599
Tom's taking the experimental
approach with his churros.

783
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,599
My bake is called Tom's Fennel
Churros Snake in the Grass.

784
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,599
A snake in the grass is always a surprise,

785
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,599
churros were a bit of a surprise,
batter week was a bit of a surprise.

786
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,599
Tom's fennel-seed churros
snake will be ssssserved with

787
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,599
a spiced saffron custard and dusted
with fragrant rosewater sugar.

788
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,599
Although this is meant
to be a sweet churros,

789
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,599
you're daring to take us to the
edge, aren't you? I love fennel.

790
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Because it does kind of walk that
line between the sweet and savoury.

791
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,599
I've gone for Japanese flavours.

792
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,599
I mean, I travelled extensively around
Japan and I love the flavour of matcha.

793
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,599
So I wanted to make churros
with matcha in them.

794
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,599
Matcha is a green-tea powder.

795
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,599
It's got kind of like
an earthy taste to it.

796
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,599
The flavour's quite subtle,
depending on how much you use.

797
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,599
To accompany his matcha-tea churros,
Rav's making a trio of dips,

798
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,599
a fruity one, a creamy pistachio
one and a chocolate one that

799
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,599
has the potential to fire
up the judges' taste buds.

800
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,599
A white chocolate and wasabi sauce.

801
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,599
Ooh, hello! Interesting.
White chocolate and wasabi.

802
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,599
Wasabi and white... Yeah. That's a first.

803
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,599
It's daring, it's out there, flavour
combinations are fascinating,

804
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
and there's no lime or coconut, which is
good. There's no lime or coconut, no!

805
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,599
620g of beer is going into my batter.

806
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,599
Beer adds quite a nice flavour.

807
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,599
Candice will also add a bit of
coconut flour to her batter.

808
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,599
She'll pipe each churro into a
figure of eight, dipping one end

809
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,599
in a sticky peanut-butter mousse
and a crunchy peanut topping.

810
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Love peanut butter.

811
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:12,599
Like, eat-it-off-the-spoon
love peanut butter.

812
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah, it's one of my favourite things.

813
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,599
Not as strong as I used to be!

814
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,599
Anyone want to take over for a minute?

815
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,599
It is a bit of hard work, but it's
fun, actually. It's getting there.

816
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,599
I don't want any lumps of flour hiding.

817
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,599
Getting a thick batter is crucial
for the churros to cook and

818
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,599
properly hold their shape.

819
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,599
It's not quite as stiff as I would
like, so it's going back on the hob.

820
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,599
I want it to hold its shape.
If it's too squidgy,

821
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,599
pipe it out in the star nozzle
and then all your star-ness goes

822
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
and it sits on the baking tray and
goes very flat on the bottom.

823
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,599
After combating consistency,
the next task is uniformity.

824
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,599
The job is getting them all the same.

825
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,599
I've got just the right consistency,
it's holding the lines.

826
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,599
Standing up like caterpillar
legs, if you know what I mean.

827
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,599
But the weight of the
churros might flatten it,

828
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,599
so you've got to be really careful.

829
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,599
I think I was a bit quick
taking my batter off the hob,

830
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,599
it's a bit thinner than I would like.

831
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,599
These are supposed to look like rabbits.

832
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,599
Wasn't quite up to a whole rabbit,
just going for little rabbity heads.

833
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,599
In a minute I'll put the
sultanas in for their eyes.

834
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,599
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail... Benjamin...
they're all here.

835
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,599
And they're all getting fried.

836
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,599
Kate's making hot-cross-bunny churros.

837
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,599
Her bunny batter is spiced
with cardamom, cinnamon,

838
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,599
ginger and a hint of nutmeg.

839
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,599
She'll dust them with a spiced sugar

840
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,599
and serve them with chocolate custard.

841
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,599
Not Christmas, we're moving on to Easter.
We've done Christmas!

842
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,599
I'm going to make more than 36
and just choose the best ones.

843
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,599
I'll just keep going. I need to make sure I
don't forget to make my custard, though.

844
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,599
Consistency is good, I'm happy
with that, so I'm just going to

845
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,599
pipe as many as I can and
then just use the best ones.

846
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,599
Benjamina's opted for
coconut-flavoured churros,

847
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,599
and to emphasise her tropical
twist she's serving them with

848
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
a passion fruit and mango dipping sauce.

849
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
It's kind of like a teardrop shape.

850
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:09,599
They're just a bit different, I
didn't want to do straight lines.

851
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,599
And these are quite easy to pick up,
so I thought these will be cute.

852
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Piping it is... a doddle.

853
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,599
I can't do 36 like that. It's
too stiff to pipe. Looks good.

854
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,599
No, it... Well...

855
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,599
While some struggle with piping,

856
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,599
one baker's risking an
extra stage before frying.

857
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,599
Good morning, Selasi. Good morning.
Tell us all about your churros.

858
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,599
Erm, I'm making lemon and anise churros.

859
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,599
I'm going to make them into
some just small bowls,

860
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,599
so I'm using that to pipe around it,
freeze it for about half an hour

861
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,599
before frying, just so
it's easier to come off.

862
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,599
So you don't thaw them before you fry them?
No, fry them from frozen.

863
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,599
Selasi's also adding
cinnamon to his churros.

864
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,599
He'll then fill each one with
a raspberry cream before

865
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,599
topping them all off with a white
and plain chocolate circle.

866
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,599
I don't know, it feels
thinner, this consistency.

867
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,599
Thinner than I've tried at home.
That's not good.

868
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,599
I put them to chill so that
they hold their shape,

869
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,599
particularly cos I seem to have made
softer batter than I was making at home.

870
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,599
If they're still warm,

871
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,599
I'm not going to get a nice,
rigid line in my churros.

872
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,599
I want them to be as cold as I can
get them but without being frozen.

873
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,599
I'm not chilling,

874
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,599
but I am going to leave them to
stand and just firm up a fraction.

875
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,599
Jane's filling her churros
with flavours inspired by

876
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,599
her daughter's love of pistachios.

877
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,599
Each one will have a nutty
white-chocolate custard running

878
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,599
down its centre and all 36 will be
served with a boozy chocolate sauce.

879
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,599
So you're using a pistachio and
cream filling for that? Yes, I am.

880
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,599
How is that going to be
put inside that churros?

881
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,599
Erm, when they're cooked I'm going to poke

882
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,599
a hole through it and then pipe it in. OK.

883
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,599
Looking forward to this flavour
and the filling, actually,

884
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,599
to see if it complements the
actual texture of the churros.

885
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,599
Like Jane, Val has also
decided to fill her churros.

886
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,599
I'm making churros which
is flavoured with orange

887
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,599
and they're going to be filled
with the chocolate sauce.

888
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,599
To achieve this classic
flavour combination,

889
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,599
Val's added orange zest to her
churros batter and will do

890
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,599
the same to her chocolate ganache filling.

891
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,599
Once the churros are cooked and filled

892
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,599
she'll roll them in zesty spiced sugar.

893
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Chocolate orange! My children's favourite.

894
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,599
Bakers, you've got one hour left
on your churrrros. One hour left.

895
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,599
I'm going to go in with the first couple.

896
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,599
I might be able to drop them
in, cos they're stiff enough.

897
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Yeah. First ones in, 34 to go.

898
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,599
It's only now the bakers will know

899
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,599
if their churros batter
is the right consistency.

900
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,599
Too wet and they'll absorb too much oil.

901
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,599
Too dense and they'll need longer frying

902
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,599
to ensure the middle is cooked through.

903
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,599
I'm cooking them for six minutes.

904
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,599
I'm making sure I turn them over
so they don't get overly browned.

905
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,599
I'm doing them two minutes each side.

906
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,599
They're going to be very crispy,
but I want them to be crispy.

907
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,599
I'm frying at 170.

908
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,599
I'm leaving them on the baking
parchment so they keep their shape

909
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,599
as I put them in the oil, and
they naturally lift off.

910
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,600
I'm frying my churros at 190
for two minutes on each side.

911
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,599
If it's frozen, there is a danger
that the inside will not cook

912
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,599
but you just have to cook it from
frozen but for a longer period.

913
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,599
I'm going to have a go at putting six in,

914
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,599
which is a big risk if it drops
the temperature too much.

915
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,599
Just started to fry now.

916
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,599
Think I can get away with doing
three or four at a time.

917
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Oh, I'm doing as many as
I can get in at a time.

918
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,599
Churros in Spain are always piped
straight into the boiling fat.

919
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,599
But is it the right way to go
for a Showstopper Challenge?

920
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,599
If you do pipe it straight in,

921
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,599
to get 36 of the same
size is very difficult.

922
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,599
They're not coming out uniform at all.

923
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,599
They're going to taste good,
they'll look ugly as sin.

924
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,599
I'm just going for it now. I've come to terms with the
fact that I'm not going to get them exactly straight.

925
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,599
That's the risk of piping
directly into the oil.

926
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,599
Are you boiling bunnies again, Kate?
In hot oil, yes.

927
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,599
Oh, what was the film where she
cooked the rabbit? Fatal Attraction.

928
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I'm a bunny boiler!

929
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:06,600
This is Kate-al Attraction.

930
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,599
I don't think I'm happy with the batter.
It feels oily.

931
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,599
Just need to make sure it's
not raw in the middle,

932
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
cos mine is slightly thicker
than a normal churros.

933
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,599
I might have mucked them up.

934
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,599
There was one or two of them split,
because the batter was far too wet.

935
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,599
Pleased with the texture of those.

936
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,599
They all look roughly the same, don't they?
They look all right.

937
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
They are figure-of-eight shapes, so...

938
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,599
I mean, they're straight enough.
Straight as I could get them. Yeah.

939
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,599
Bakers, there's half an hour to go

940
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,599
before you're out of the
frying pan and into the fire.

941
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,599
I'm over halfway frying them.

942
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,599
I should have enough time, but we'll see.

943
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,599
Churros seems to be all about multitasking.

944
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,599
I've got to fry the churros,

945
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,599
make a chocolate soil and
make two dipping sauces.

946
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,599
Come back in three hours, I'll
still be peeling my pistachios.

947
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,599
Cos I grind it right down,

948
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,599
so I use it like a flour
to thicken my custard.

949
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,599
This is my wasabi powder.

950
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,599
You can smell how strong it is.

951
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,599
This is a little bit of a risk,
but I've tried it and it works

952
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,599
and I hope that they'll
be able to enjoy it.

953
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,599
This is the custard, it's the
base for my chocolate sauce.

954
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
It's not thick enough.

955
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,599
I'm really conscious that
I'm running out of time.

956
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,599
You've done most of your
churros, haven't you?

957
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,599
Yeah, I've got most of my churros,
got about another seven to do.

958
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
OK, good luck, my love.

959
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,599
Have you melted your chocolate yet?

960
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm really behind.

961
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,599
Nearly finished frying, thankfully,

962
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,599
because I'm just going to pipe
my custard cream in there.

963
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,599
And filling these.

964
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,599
They're a bit doughy in the middle,
and I actually like them that way.

965
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,600
I should have time to do all my extra bits.

966
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,599
One more for luck and then I am done.

967
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,599
I only need one more but I'm
going to do quite a few spares,

968
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,599
just to try and pick the straightest.

969
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Super tight for time but these
could be the last ones.

970
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,599
I'm going to run out of time.

971
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,599
Churrrrrrrrrros!

972
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,599
That's the churros alarm clock. 15
minutes, bakers. 15 minutes to go.

973
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,599
Getting to the rushing stage now. Yeah.

974
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,599
I've got enough time to kind of
play around with the way it looks.

975
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm not sure if I'm happy with them.

976
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:23,599
It looks burnt, but I'm not sure.

977
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,600
They're looking OK, I've just
got to get a lot of them done.

978
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Oh, my gosh. One, two, three, four...

979
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,599
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11, 12...

980
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,599
17, 18...

981
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,599
There was a couple I wasn't
entirely happy with but they'll do.

982
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Oh-ho-ho!

983
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,599
OK, bakers, just five minutes until
we say "churrio" to this challenge.

984
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,599
Five minutes! Five minutes.

985
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,599
Oh, I'm not getting there.

986
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Keep going, keep going, we can do
it, we can do it. We know we can.

987
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,599
Holy moley.

988
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,599
Come on, come on, come on.

989
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Perilously short on time.

990
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,599
God, look at that. Looks just
like a snake, doesn't it?

991
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,599
Are you done? Yeah, I'm done. Do
you need a hand with anything?

992
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,599
You can help me put them on the plate.
You're a star.

993
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,599
Bakers, one minute to go. One
minute left on this challenge.

994
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,600
I need to get some chocolate
sauce in this pan.

995
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,600
Thank you. OK, bakers, that's time up.
Time is up.

996
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,599
It's judgment time.

997
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Val, would you like to bring
your churros up, my darling?

998
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,599
They are all the same length.

999
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,600
You've been able to keep the ridges,
which you expect for a churros.

1000
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,599
It's beautifully crisp.
The definition is good.

1001
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
But the sauce is too runny.

1002
00:50:11,601 --> 00:50:14,599
Inside, the chocolate that you
put in there is delicious.

1003
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,599
But, unfortunately, it's taken away
all the interior of the churros,

1004
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,599
and what's left is just a bit doughy.

1005
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,599
Little bit disappointing.

1006
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Sorry.

1007
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,599
That's a great imagination with the snake.

1008
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,600
What's this here at the top?

1009
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:33,599
It was supposed to be a head, but...
They're a good colour.

1010
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,600
There's quite a lot of sugar on it.

1011
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Wow.

1012
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,599
It's overdone.

1013
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,599
It's been cooked for too long,
so it's just dried it out.

1014
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,599
I do like the flavour. I
question, is it sweet, though?

1015
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,599
It's a fennel doughnut.

1016
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Shall we say if you're
fond of fennel, it's fine?

1017
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
But it's difficult to eat and a bit tough.

1018
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,599
They are a pretty dark colour.

1019
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,599
I would expect them to be a little
bit more delicate than that.

1020
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,600
They're a little bit clumsy.
They're burnt, Selasi.

1021
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Are they?

1022
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:14,599
PAUL CHUCKLES

1023
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Right.

1024
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,599
And raw dough.

1025
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,599
That's a shame.

1026
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,599
Such a good idea to do it
on top of those bun tins.

1027
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
It's come from the freezer,

1028
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,599
so the dough down at the
bottom is actually raw dough.

1029
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
So, overall, not a good day.

1030
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,599
There's real flavour there.

1031
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,599
Beautiful pistachio, and
you've kept the colour.

1032
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,599
You took the skin off the pistachios.
I did. Um...

1033
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,599
I really love them, actually. Oh, do you?!
I like... Thank you!

1034
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,599
I've been so worried about them!

1035
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,599
I really like the flavour.

1036
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,599
Your dip is beautiful. It's lovely.
It holds.

1037
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,599
That's a good dipping sauce.

1038
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,599
Thank you. I've never had a churro.

1039
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
You've got 35 now. I...

1040
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,599
It's difficult to judge
the colour on these,

1041
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
cos they were so green,

1042
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:17,599
and that will obviously affect
the way it'll fry, as well.

1043
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,599
The problem is, some of the
shapes are a bit strange. Yes.

1044
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,600
We're looking for consistency
in this challenge.

1045
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,599
They're a bit fatty. Yeah.

1046
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,599
The flavour is not good. OK.

1047
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,599
It does taste quite savoury.
Which dip would you recommend?

1048
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,599
Try the wasabi, come on.

1049
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,599
The passion fruit is good.
Mm. It's excellent.

1050
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,599
Overall, I don't think they
look particularly nice.

1051
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
I don't like the flavour.

1052
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,600
You're normally very good on your flavours.

1053
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,599
I like the look of it. It's pretty uniform.

1054
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,599
I like the idea of the two flavours.

1055
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,599
You've got the bottom and then the top.

1056
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,599
You've got definition in there as well.
And a good thickness.

1057
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,600
The overall appearance is quite clever.

1058
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,599
I can't actually get into the texture,

1059
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,599
cos it's been overcooked, basically.

1060
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,599
So inside, it's only a
very thin line of texture

1061
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,599
within the churros itself.

1062
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,600
The fat has impregnated
it a little too much.

1063
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,599
They look a bit sad, don't they? I know.

1064
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,599
I can sort of see a rough bunny rabbit,

1065
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,599
but it's very flat, it's been run over.

1066
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,600
It's roadkill! OK.

1067
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,599
I know the oil's got through more
than I would have liked it to.

1068
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,599
It's beautifully crisp.

1069
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,599
But it's totally impregnated
with the oil. Yeah.

1070
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,599
And we're getting no centrepiece
of the nice churros. Yeah.

1071
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,599
I can't eat that. No, it's too
oily, I know it's too oily. It is.

1072
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,599
Too slack. It's solid crisp.
There's no filling to it at all.

1073
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
I've had a bad bake.

1074
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,599
All of them are a beautiful shape.

1075
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,599
I think that your mixture

1076
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,599
was a little bit on the slack...
on the runny side.

1077
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,600
It looks as though it hasn't
held the ridges that we expect.

1078
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,599
Because they're so small,

1079
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,599
when you get into them, they
are a little bit fatty.

1080
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,600
I think your mixture needed to be a
bit stiffer. OK. And a bit bigger.

1081
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
What a pleasant colour they are.

1082
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,599
They're quite thin,

1083
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,599
but you've been able to keep
the definition of the piping.

1084
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
Great display. Lovely colour.

1085
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:39,599
The actual shape of them I love.

1086
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
That is the right thickness for a churros.

1087
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
That's the colour it should be inside.

1088
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,599
They are beautiful. Oh, thank you.
Absolutely beautiful.

1089
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,599
Crispy, they look good, great frying.

1090
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Well done. You've cracked it.
Oh, thank you!

1091
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,599
Who's in contention for
Star Baker this week?

1092
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,599
I think Benjamina has done well.
Andrew, as well.

1093
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,599
Came fourth in Technical, did
really well on the Signature.

1094
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,599
How did we feel about Kate's performance?

1095
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,599
It was so disappointing.

1096
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
They were fatty all the way through.

1097
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:24,599
I was upset about Selasi,
as well, actually.

1098
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,599
Tom's had a bit of a
nightmare, as well, hasn't he?

1099
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600
He has had a nightmare.

1100
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:31,599
Before this challenge, we knew that
Kate, Tom and Rav were in trouble.

1101
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Has anything changed, Mary?

1102
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:35,599
There are two that will
be possibly leaving.

1103
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
Tom and Kate.

1104
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:39,599
I have to say Rav, as well.
Good luck, Paul and Mary.

1105
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
The decision lies in your hands.

1106
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,599
OK, bakers, well done, all of you.
You've worked extremely hard.

1107
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,599
And I have the nice job.

1108
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,600
I get to award Star Baker,

1109
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:03,599
and Paul and Mary have decided
overwhelmingly in favour...

1110
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
of Benjamina.

1111
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:06,599
Well done, Benjamina! You are Star Baker.

1112
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
So surprised!

1113
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,599
Well done.

1114
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,599
I have the harder, sadder task
this week, unfortunately,

1115
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
but you know the score.

1116
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:19,599
Somebody has to leave the tent.

1117
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
With great sadness, the person
leaving us this week is...

1118
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
..Kate.

1119
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:29,600
I knew it was me. Kate, come on.

1120
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,599
I don't think I've completely
humiliated myself.

1121
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,599
There's been some fantastic bakes in
amongst some of the shocking ones!

1122
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,599
I feel really guilty. No, it's fine.
I had a shocking week.

1123
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,599
I'm not going to cry because it's over,

1124
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,599
because I'm going to get to watch now

1125
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
and see who finishes this journey.

1126
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:48,599
Is Kate the weakest baker out of the group?
No, she isn't.

1127
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,599
But this weekend, she was.
That's how Bake Off works.

1128
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,599
HE PUFFS OUT

1129
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,599
That was by the skin of my teeth.
I was so convinced I was going.

1130
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
I'm surprised I'm still here.

1131
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:01,599
I'm like a cat with nine lives, it seems.

1132
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,599
Oh, was I thrilled to see
Benjamina's churros!

1133
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,599
Sheer joy. She did brilliantly.

1134
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
Thank you.

1135
00:57:08,601 --> 00:57:11,599
I conquered the batter!

1136
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Star Baker! Whoo-whoo!

1137
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Really, really, really happy.

1138
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Next time...

1139
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,599
I was so calm earlier.

1140
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,599
..the bakers perfect their pastry skills...

1141
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,599
That's a very intense measurement.

1142
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,600
..in a multilayered Signature...

1143
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:28,599
There should be 27 layers,
but I get confused.

1144
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,599
..a well-baked Technical...

1145
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,599
Oh, my word! The oven wasn't on.

1146
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
..and a bite-sized Showstopper...

1147
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:35,599
Oh, we're going to be tight on this.

1148
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,599
..that will stretch the bakers
further than ever before.

1149
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,599
This is why life is too
short to make filo pastry.

1150
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,600
That's what you call a proper disaster.

1151
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
