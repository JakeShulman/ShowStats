00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,500
In the beginning...

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,780
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,020
Oh!

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,220
..there were 12.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,420
I can't believe that's
just happened to me.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,660
They're not going to allow
me into Yorkshire ever again.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,660
Now...there are three.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,780
Right, calm down now.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,620
(Good luck, guys.)

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,660
Good luck, guys.

'Winning Star Baker in the first week...'

12
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,620
No!

'..Jane got off to a flying start.'

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,100
Absolutely beautiful, yes.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,300
Thank you.

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,700
'Her home-style baking
impressed Mary and Paul.'

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,180
That is first-rate.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,820
This is a complete mess.

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,460
'Although timing often
wasn't on her side.'

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,940
Things didn't go to plan.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,180
No, they didn't.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,300
'The garden designer dug deep
to make it to the final.'

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,780
That fleur-de-lis is outstanding.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,140
Thank you.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,820
To be at the final is just amazing.

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,660
It feels really unreal, actually.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,940
People say to you, "Oh, how've you been?

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,620
"What's happened this week?"

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,740
You go, "You know,
nothing, really, same old,"

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
and you want to go, "I'm in the final

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,300
"of The Great British Bake Off!"

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,340
And you can't.

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,700
Candice has won Star Baker three times.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,100
Well done.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Her elaborate creations...

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
Wow, exceptional.

37
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
..went the extra mile...

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,980
It's like you, isn't it? You
like to do things over the top.

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,820
..and both impressed and
frustrated the judges.

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,500
Rein it in a little bit. Get
your baking absolutely spot-on.

41
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,900
But with bakes inspired by her family...

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,580
- The overall effect is beautiful.
- Yes!

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,900
..she's made it to the final.

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,380
There's been a lot of practice this week.

45
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,620
The other day, I did baking
for 12 hours, and I hurt a lot.

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,380
I'd really like to think I'd,
like, got really fit and toned

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,180
and everything from baking.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,580
Definitely haven't.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,900
Definitely struggling to
fit in clothes currently.

50

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,540

'..was a turning point.'

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,060
I've never seen a mechanised pie.

65
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,980
'At last he won Star Baker...'

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
The presentation is stunning.

67
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,980
'..and won it again in the semifinal.'

68
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,020
Coming in, I really
wanted to make the final.

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,020
That was my number one objective,
and then if I can win it...

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,900
That seemed like a
silly dream at the time,

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,700
but now that we're here,

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,260
I've got to darn well try.

73
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,580
Bakers, finalists!

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,700
Welcome to the tent. And the
final this year is being given...

75
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,380
..the royal treatment.

76
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,820
Between the four of us,

77
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,620
we already have a sponge sceptre
and several jellied orbs,

78
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,580
but Mary and Paul would
like to complete the set

79
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,340
by giving you the challenge of
making a filled meringue crown.

80
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,180
We're not talking some little
nimby-pimby tiny crown.

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,980
No, bakers, we want a family-sized crown

82
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,660
big enough for the whole royal family.

83
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,780
It must have three layers
of meringue, at least...

84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,860
..and it must be dazzlingly decorated.

85
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,540
You've got three hours on this challenge.

86
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,460
- On your marks...
- Get set... - Bake!

87
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
Good luck.

88
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,460
Good luck, guys.

89
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,220
The nerves are a bit jangly.
I've dropped a bowl already.

90
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,780
It is the final.

91
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,340
We've been waiting for this,

92
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,100
and I think it's quite right we go royal.

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,220
After all, it is the
Queen's 90th birthday year.

94
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,260
This is the last signature chance,

95
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,540
so we've chosen meringue.

96
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Now, they've struggled
with meringue in the past,

97
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,420
so I thought it was a good idea
to go back to the meringue again.

98
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,580
We've asked for a crown.

99
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,780
How they achieve that is up to them,

100
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,820
but what I am looking for -

101
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,540
it's got to taste good, look
good and be spectacular.

102
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,260
Three tiers of meringue can be
quite sweet and overwhelming,

103
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,300
so they've got to add a
little bit of tartness to it.

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
That can come from the fruit -
whether it's a curd, a compote,

105
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,540
that will balance out the
sweetness of the meringue.

106
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,660
I haven't any idea who's going to win.

107
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,220
It's an open field.

108
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,700
I'm looking forward to it.

109
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,900
Good morning, Jane.

110
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,500
- Good morning.
- Right, tell us all about your meringue crown.

111
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,540
My meringue crown is a red,
white and blue meringue crown

112
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,700
with strawberry and raspberry compote,

113
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
and then the next layer
is a blueberry compote,

114
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,420
and then the top is white flesh
nectarines with other fruits.

115
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
Jane's red, white and blue pavlova

116
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,020
is her husband Ray's favourite dessert.

117
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,260
She's hoping that sticking with her
tried and tested family favourite

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,540
will be a hit with Paul and Mary.

119
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,940
Now, you've kept it fairly
simple for the final.

120
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,260
I have kept it simple, but I want
it to be a good pavlova at the end.

121
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,220
Guys, simple is good, surely?

122
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,700
Well, it comes down to perfection.

123
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,020
When you go simple, we are
looking for the best flavours,

124
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,900
the best look with no failure.

125
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,180
No pressure, then!

126
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,340
All three bakers have opted
for a pavlova-style meringue.

127
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,020
I'm using muscovado
sugar as well as caster.

128
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,620
It gives it a more caramelly
flavour, which I quite like,

129
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,980
but can lead to
easier-collapsing meringues.

130
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,740
Can tend to crack slightly,
but flavour wins, right?

131
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,540
This is just caster sugar.

132
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,380
I want a nice, as white
as possible, meringue.

133
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,140
True to form for this regal signature...

134
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,380
It needs to be just right.
Just like Goldilocks.

135
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,140
..Candice is going a little further.

136
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,700
I am doing two different meringues.

137
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,100
One of them I'm adding
white caster sugar,

138
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,340
and the other one will
have golden caster sugar.

139
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,860
Her two different meringues will
make three tiers of pavlova,

140
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,820
filled with Prosecco-soaked strawberries,

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,260
mango curd, gold-dusted Physalis

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
and glittered pistachios.

143
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,740
Then there's a fourth tier,

144
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,180
inspired by the tiny
crown of Queen Victoria.

145
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,020
You've chosen to do quite a lot
of different things, actually.

146
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,700
- Yep.
- You've got to do it all in the time.

147
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,540
I have got to do it all in the time,

148
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,380
but I think once the meringues are in,

149
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,140
the bits in the middle I can fill.

150
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,740
As long as they've got their
cooking time and their cooling time,

151
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,900
so they're nice and crisp,

152
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,420
then it's just a case of building it up.

153
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,900
- All right, good luck.
- Thank you.

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,260
I thought I'd reined it in.

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,660
I didn't think I was going
complicated at all this week.

156
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,140
I've got three main
layers, three flavours,

157
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,540
one mini crown, a curd and some fruit.

158
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,020
Nothing.

159
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,020
So, I've increased the speed now
that all the sugar's been added,

160
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,740
and then I'm looking
for really solid peaks.

161
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,940
There's nowhere to hide if
the meringue goes wrong.

162
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,460
There will be no time to remake.

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,540
If it isn't beaten until
it's completely stiff...

164
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,260
Still soft.

165
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,020
..when piped, the meringue
will lose its shape...

166
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
..and then collapse as it's baked.

167
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,620
Suddenly feeling really nervous.

168
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,900
Oh, how can meringue do this to you, eh?

169
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,420
I'm just going freehand on my circle.

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,820
Whoops!

171
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,660
That's going to be my
meringue cross on top.

172
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,180
The next meringue is
going to have colour.

173
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,460
This is going to have pistachio on it.

174
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,620
So my Queen Victoria
crown will go on here.

175
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,300
I wanted to feature that cos I
loved that when I was younger.

176
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,500
You do need steady hands.

177
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,260
Just applying some gold lustre to
give it a nice vibrant royal look.

178
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,020
Good morning, Andrew. How are you?

179
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,700
Good morning, I'm very well, thank you.

180
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,980
Tell us about this meringue.

181
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,380
This is just a classic meringue

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,820
and I've used a 50-50 caster
sugar to muscovado composition.

183
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,540
- Yeah.
- I'm just going to pop them in the oven.

184
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,260
And you're confident about getting
it all finished and looking good?

185
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,820
I have had a couple of
slight meringue collapses,

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,380
so I'm a little nervous about
the structure at the end.

187
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,900
But hopefully my added
rings in the centre will...

188
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,700
- Give it support.
- Yeah.

189
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,820
Andrew's engineering
expertise will be fully tested

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,100
in his re-creation of
the Queen's Jubilee crown

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
in muscovado meringue.

192
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,660
It will contain a pecan praline centre

193
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,820
and layers of blackberry fool,

194
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,340
topped off with cassis jelly jewels.

195
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,260
Now, you've chosen a difficult meringue.

196
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,140
Muscovado sugar, being very moist,

197
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,500
and I notice that it is quite
runny now... I hope it holds.

198
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,540
My engineering credentials
are going to be tested.

199
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,340
They will be. Severely.

200
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,740
Right, going in. I'm leaving it in
there for an hour and ten minutes.

201
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,260
They're going to go in the oven
for about an hour and 20 minutes.

202
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm baking mine for an hour
on a fairly low temperature.

203
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,740
About 130.

204
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,300
Now is the bit I can enjoy a bit more.

205
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,940
They're in the oven. I can't worry
about them, I can't change them.

206
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,500
It's in the hands of
chemistry and the gods.

207
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,460
The finalists need to spend every minute

208
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,420
that the meringues are in the oven

209
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,540
perfecting their fillings and toppings.

210
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,060
Now I get to make the jellied jewels.

211
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,620
I'm adding gelatine, some creme cassis.

212
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,500
I just love blackberries, so
I'm going for gold and purple.

213
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,460
It was inspired by the
Queen's coronation crown.

214
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,780
I have got some blueberries, a bit
of sugar, a bit of lemon juice,

215
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,980
a little bit of water.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm going to make a blueberry compote

217
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,260
and then a strawberry and
raspberry compote as well.

218
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,900
Nothing like British
fresh fruit, is there?

219
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,580
This is my pecan praline.

220
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,940
I'm hoping I've put this on
the right side of the paper.

221
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,620
This is mango curd.

222
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,220
As it's a special occasion,

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,540
this is Prosecco for my strawberries.

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,940
(Aah!)

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,300
There's two sides to the baking paper

226
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,820
and I've put it on the wrong one.

227
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,500
As you can see, it...

228
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,700
Facepalm.

229
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,140
45 minutes remain in the
final Signature Challenge.

230
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,300
The oven is turned off, so I'm
just waiting for them to cool down.

231
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,740
They've finished baking.

232
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,740
Technically now it's more
important to let them cool down

233
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,140
really, really slowly.

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,580
Sudden changes in temperature
could destroy the meringue...

235
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,420
I'm just on crack watch.

236
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,300
..and will make constructing
a crown impossible.

237
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,580
Two minutes. I'm just going
to hold my nerve. Two minutes.

238
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,060
I'm coming out. I'm going...

239
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,020
If you rush it, you open the
door of the oven and get them out

240
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,780
and you can hear them
going, "Ping! Ping! Ping!"

241
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,660
You can actually hear them cracking.

242
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,100
I might just put them back

243
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,980
in the open oven just to reduce
the temperature shock a bit.

244
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,300
- What are you listening for?
- I don't know.

245
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,140
Jane just said, "Can
you hear it crackling?"

246
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,940
So I thought I'd listen.

247
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,780
Eat me! Eat me!

248
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,420
This one is looking a little stronger.

249
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,580
Oh, gosh! My stomach just turned over.

250
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,180
The bottom one has cracked.

251
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,780
(Oh, look. They are amazing!)

252
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,620
You can't out-Candice Candice.

253
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,140
You've just got to be
happy with what you do.

254
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,620
Perfection is all I've got to hit today.

255
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,900
Bakers, here's the story.

256
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,060
You've got 15 minutes
on your crowning glory.

257
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm sorry to be bore-y.

258
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,220
This is where you find out
if the meringues have stuck,

259
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,620
and try and keep smiling
if that's the case.

260
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,340
'The judges are looking for at least
three tiers of crowning glory.'

261
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,380
Oh, hello!

262
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,940
Oh, don't do that.

263
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,780
My cream has whipped up
nice and light, actually.

264
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,340
It is mascarpone, double
cream and vanilla.

265
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,060
OK.

266
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,140
It looks like we might
have got away with it.

267
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,140
I just need to start constructing.

268
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,980
- What's going on, my love?
- So, I'm going to...

269
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,700
try and stick this on
with a bit of caramel.

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,780
Carefully, carefully.

271
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,380
Blueberry compote. It
is a little bit runny,

272
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,740
but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a blueberry dam.

273
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,020
God, it's a delicate beast.

274
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Praline to go in the middle.

275
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,140
These are my jewelled pistachios.

276
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,220
This is blackberry fool. I
want this to be slightly sharp.

277
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,780
There is a lot of sugar in the meringue,

278
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,660
so I don't want it to be too sweet.

279
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,460
My bottom is cracking. I can see it.

280
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,580
I'll just about have enough cream.

281
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,100
Whoops!

282
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm just going to shine up my Physalis.

283
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,660
You want to make sure you get that right.

284
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,100
Five minutes, bakers.
Just five minutes left.

285
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,180
Oh, jelly. Jelly, jelly!

286
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,660
(He's putting it on the Queen.)

287
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,900
OK, bakers, that's it.

288
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,460
Time is up.

289
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,900
Coronation time, gang.

290
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,180
Paul and Mary are expecting
a spectacular meringue crown

291
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,940
with at least three tiers and
full of delicious fillings.

292
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,980
You've chosen a meringue
using muscovado sugar,

293
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,940
which is very difficult
to get definition.

294
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,420
If we look at the top here,

295
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,380
we haven't got a clear
definition of your icing pipe.

296
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
I'm going to take a slice.

297
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,820
You've got to keep it
very much on the head.

298
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,060
Yes.

299
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,940
Tell me, what's happening in the middle?

300
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,540
I put the pecan praline in there.

301
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,500
All the flavours go well.

302
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,060
The praline is very, very sweet

303
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,780
and it's slightly
overpowering everything.

304
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,020
Obviously meringue is sweet,

305
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,900
therefore, for me, the rest
needs to be a little bit sharp.

306
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,860
The fool hasn't got much flavour to it.

307
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,380
I think the meringue's gorgeous.
It's nice and soft inside.

308
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,580
You've got a nice chew.

309
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,620
The jelly, I like. It's
got a lot of flavour in it.

310
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,740
It has got more of a kick,
actually, than the fool has.

311
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,660
I don't like the praline in the
middle, but I love the effect.

312
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,820
OK.

313
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,580
I think it looks great.

314
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,820
I love the pipework. There's
a lot going on in there.

315
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,180
- Yeah.
- I was a bit worried about this little crown on the top,

316
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,860
how you were going to
get it off the moulds,

317
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
but you've managed to get it off OK.

318
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,340
It looks impressive,

319
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,900
and I love the way you've
got so many flavours there.

320
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,340
I didn't think you'd finish, but you did.

321
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,660
Oooft!

322
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,180
You can actually feel the texture
of the meringues all the way down.

323
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,700
- Oh!
- The way it's holding is quite impressive.

324
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,660
It's actually staying in one piece,

325
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,860
and what a piece of meringue that is!

326
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,900
Wow!

327
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,500
Your curd is lovely.

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,340
The meringue, it's got a
lovely softness in the middle.

329
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,660
There's so many textures in there,
and the flavours are quite sharp.

330
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,020
And you've got the nuts in there as
well, which adds something to it.

331
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,740
Yeah, I like that.

332
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,500
A handshake! Hollywood
handshake!

333
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,900
(Handshake!)

334
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,020
You've made, from
appearance point of view,

335
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,820
a first-rate meringue.

336
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,380
It's held all its shape perfectly.

337
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,660
I can't wait to get the texture
of that meringue, you know.

338
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,340
It does look very impressive.

339
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,980
- Yeah, it does.
- Oh, thank you.

340
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,340
Oh, the way that the
knife just falls through!

341
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,340
Look how solid it is at
the bottom there as well.

342
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,460
Perfect, isn't it?

343
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,780
The flavours go very well.

344
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,740
Your coulis is sharp, and do
you know what is really sharp?

345
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,220
The peach on top,

346
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,420
which is just what you
need with a pavlova.

347
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,540
Because it's so tall,

348
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,420
it's very difficult for it
to actually hold together

349
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,100
when you cut it.

350
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,500
Your description of a sort of
pavlova trifle is about right.

351
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,340
I sense... I knew... Oh, hello!

352
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,780
Oh, thank you!

353
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,220
Thank you.

354
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,740
Three layers of heaven.

355
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,260
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you very much indeed.

356
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,300
I'm absolutely delighted.
I got the handshake!

357
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,140
When Candice got her
handshake, I thought,

358
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,660
"I've never seen two handshakes.

359
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,580
"I've never seen two
handshakes. Not a chance."

360
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,180
And I got a handshake!

361
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,260
He's giving out handshakes willy-nilly.

362
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,020
But, no, Jane's did look spectacular.

363
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,460
First bake of final done

364
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,060
and I couldn't really have
got off to a better start,

365
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,540
which is amazing.

366
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,900
It was a bit of a kick in the teeth
to have, like, the double handshake.

367
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,980
I can deal with one.
Two is a bit, like...

368
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,900
Really, I need to come
first in the Technical.

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,140
Definitely at the back of
the pack at the moment.

370
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,660
Now, bakers, this is your
last ever Technical Challenge.

371
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
Any advice, Mary?

372
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,820
This bake will be very familiar,

373
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,100
but there are one or two
tricky things about it.

374
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,540
Wow, cryptic!

375
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,300
Now, off you both go to
your intimacy workshop.

376
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,700
Catch you later.

377
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,140
OK. Now, Mary would love you to make a...

378
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,580
Victoria sandwich with
jam and buttercream.

379
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,060
But there's a twist.

380
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,940
Lift that up, you'll see boxing gloves.

381
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,620
Put them on, then the Zorro mask,
then just tease the trousers down

382
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,100
and you're ready to go.

383
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,020
You've got an hour and a
half on your challenge.

384
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
- On your marks...
- Get set... - Bake!

385
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,260
OK.

386
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,940
We have absolutely no instructions.

387
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,340
Are you ready for this?

388
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,580
"Make a Victoria sandwich
using two 20cm tins

389
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,540
"filled with raspberry
jam and buttercream."

390
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,580
That's it.

391
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,940
Right.

392
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,940
So, Mary, you've chosen a classic
challenge for the last Technical.

393
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,780
Victoria sandwich.

394
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,580
We've given them no recipe, no method,

395
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,500
just two tins and the ingredients.

396
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,460
Now, you've judged quite
a few Victoria sandwiches

397
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,420
- in your time, I'm sure.
- I've never counted.

398
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,260
I mean, I've done village
shows, county shows, schools...

399
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,380
So I know exactly what it should be.

400
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,180
They can do it by the all-in-one method,

401
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,820
they can do it by the creaming method,

402
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,060
but it should look exactly
like that when it's finished.

403
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,380
Beautifully level, a very even rise,

404
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,980
pale golden all the way around,

405
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,620
and a beautiful texture inside.

406
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,980
It's going to be fascinating
to see how they cope with this.

407
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,100
I hope the bakers come up
with something that's good.

408
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,140
I think they will.

409
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,420
Unsalted butter, we've got salted butter.

410
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
We've got medium eggs,
we've got large eggs.

411
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,380
We've got... No idea what that is.

412
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,460
My ratios are 225g of self-raising flour,

413
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,060
butter, sugar, four large eggs...

414
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,500
I'm going to go for four large eggs.

415
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,980
Victoria sponge is all about
having exactly the same amount

416
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,300
of every ingredient.

417
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,380
I'm weighing the eggs
because it's the final

418
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,500
and weighing the eggs feels
like the right thing to do.

419
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,700
259g of everything.

420
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,700
So, 227 self-raising, butter and caster.

421
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,460
I always use golden caster sugar at home,

422
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,220
so I'm going to use
golden caster sugar here.

423
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,220
I'm going to go caster. I
don't want it to be too dark.

424
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm going to do it exactly how
I do it at home, all in one.

425
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,420
I'm going to do an all-in-one method,

426
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,860
which is a Mary favourite, I think.

427
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,980
I'm going to cream the
butter and sugar first.

428
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,260
I'm going to go for the creamy method.

429
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,580
I don't actually make a
lot of Victoria sponges.

430
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,940
I'm relying on memory.

431
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,420
We should know how to do
it, but if it goes wrong,

432
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,420
we're going to use look pretty daft.

433
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,860
Have I put everything in
that I should have done?

434
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,780
Eggs might help.

435
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,260
How are you, love? How's the final going?

436
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,420
I could use with this one
being a good one, to be honest.

437
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,300
To be out of the handshake
club was a little demoralising.

438
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,420
- Matey!
- I know, the double handshake.

439
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,340
But the handshake
doesn't mean everything.

440
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,940
You have come back from things
before, Andrew, haven't you?

441
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,620
I have, but this isn't about coming back,

442
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,980
this is about ending up on top, isn't it?

443
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,660
(Oh, Andrew, that's fighting talk!)

444
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,900
I mean, you've got to be open
at this stage, haven't you?

445
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,740
- Everyone wants to win.
- Everyone. - Everyone in this tent.

446
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,780
Or die trying!

447
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,700
Just to be extra anorak-like,

448
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,140
I'm going to make sure I weigh
how much batter goes into each.

449
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,980
Slightly larger tins than I
use at home, but that's fine.

450
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Just whack in some more mix.

451
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,860
It is important that it is level.

452
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,460
If it doesn't go right,
then I'm in big trouble.

453
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm going in!

454
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,740
I should have 456 in each
if I've done that correctly,

455
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,220
which I hope I have.

456
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,660
There we go. 180 for 15 minutes,

457
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,940
but I think it will be more like 20, 25.

458
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,900
I've put it on 180 for 20
minutes to start off with.

459
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,620
I just really want to
get it in the oven now

460
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,140
cos I'm very behind the other two.

461
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,980
I'm going to go in with that.

462
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,860
Mid-shelf.

463
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,620
Start with 20, and then
I'll keep an eye on them.

464
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,860
I'm nervous about this,

465
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,420
because a tiny imperfection in a cake

466
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,700
could mean last in the Technical.

467
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,500
It's got to be right. Got to be right.

468
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,900
I am just going to get my jam on.

469
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm going for half the quantity
of sugar to raspberries.

470
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,140
- Is it?
- I'm using 50-50.

471
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,900
Just the way I make it at home.

472
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,620
I've gone for 350g of
raspberries and 150g of sugar.

473
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,500
I never use buttercream at home.

474
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,060
A drop more milk in there.

475
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,900
You don't want it to be too thick.

476
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,980
In my experience, adding
it a spoonful at a time

477
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,460
gives a smoother buttercream.

478
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,940
I've tried it all-in-one before,
but it tends to go a bit grainy.

479
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,820
It could be the smallest
thing today that clinches it.

480
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,540
I need this.

481
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,940
I really need this.

482
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,180
Bakers, just half an hour till
I have your cake and eat it.

483
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,540
Mary is going to be looking
for a nice golden colour.

484
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,940
Maybe a little rise,
but more or less flat.

485
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,660
A bit dark on top.

486
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,260
(Mine are flatter than
Candice's, though.)

487
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,740
Relatively happy. They're
the right colour, so...

488
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,660
Candice's look good and Andrew's
look really nice over there as well.

489
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,820
(Oh, it's tense, this, isn't it?)

490
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,300
My jam is not as firm
as I'd like it to be.

491
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,580
Another 15 minutes in the
fridge will probably help.

492
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,300
All going for seedless over there.

493
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,340
This is my interpretation.

494
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,620
It's either going to work, or it's not.

495
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,780
You have five minutes left on your
last-ever Technical Challenge.

496
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,860
It is the final, so I'm going
to pipe the buttercream in.

497
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,660
We're going to end up
doing the very same look.

498
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,820
It means there'll be
more direct comparisons.

499
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,940
If I'm honest, being
directly compared to Jane

500
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,340
is quite intimidating.

501
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,140
I think that looks yummy.

502
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,900
Right, you magnificent
spongers, time is up.

503
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,660
Could you bring them up to
the gingham table, please?

504
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,540
Mary and Paul are looking for
a perfect Victoria sandwich

505
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,260
with a light sponge filled with
raspberry jam and buttercream icing.

506
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,540
OK, shall we start with this one, Mary?

507
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,300
This one looks quite dark, actually.

508
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,860
It looks a bit too dark, and this
jam doesn't look as though it's set.

509
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,900
You can see it dripping
down the side there.

510
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,060
It's really a jelly rather than a jam,

511
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,180
because the pips have been taken out.

512
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,620
The actual sandwich -
the structure looks good.

513
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,540
It's a good, even texture throughout.

514
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,420
I think the Victoria
sandwich tastes good,

515
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,140
but that buttercream is quite grainy.

516
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,300
Right, moving on. This has
a nice texture on this one.

517
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,580
It's quite even. I like
the colour on this as well.

518
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,060
I like the buttercream in there.

519
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,860
- It's quite neat.
- Looks a very good jam there.

520
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,100
It's a good thing I like
a Victoria sandwich.

521
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,420
You notice what a big piece
I'm taking of each one!

522
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,380
It's buttery, it's got good flavour.

523
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,220
- That's a good Victoria sandwich, that, it tastes good.
- Mmm.

524
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,100
Moving on to the last one, Mary.

525
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,460
It's a little bit on the dark side

526
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,340
and it has a very large rise to it.

527
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,780
I think it's got a lot
of mixture in there.

528
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,700
- A lot of mixture.
- It's considerably bigger.

529
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,980
The buttercream is a
bit on the soft side.

530
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,860
The jam is quite thick, actually.

531
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,340
They have cooked it through,
and it is a good flavour.

532
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,300
OK. This is going to be tricky.

533
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,700
But which finalist has baked

534
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,260
a technically perfect Victoria sandwich?

535
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,660
This has been a very
difficult task for us.

536
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,180
We've been backwards and forwards.

537
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,380
It was very close between two and
three, I'll tell you that much.

538
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,620
In third place is this one.

539
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,260
There was more mixture in there
than I would have expected,

540
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,820
and the jam itself was
a little bit gluey.

541
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,180
And the buttercream was very soft.

542
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,140
In second place is this one.

543
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,940
The flavour of your jam was
better, marginally, than Jane's.

544
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,220
The buttercream, however,
was a little bit grainy.

545
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,220
But the overall flavour of the
sponge was just a little bit better.

546
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,380
Thank you.

547
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,620
And in first place is this one.

548
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,980
Well done, Andrew.

549
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,380
We have an even bake, a
nice pale, golden colour.

550
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,260
We've got a good jam and a
lovely, smooth buttercream.

551
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,980
Thank you.

552
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,540
Well done, well done.

553
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,860
To stand a chance at all,
I needed to come first.

554
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,540
And, yeah, really pleasantly surprised.

555
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,820
Two is all right. I thought
I was going to be third.

556
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,660
I do think, genuinely, we are
all going into it fairly even,

557
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,180
and that's quite nice.

558
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,380
I think the trophy is still
very much up for grabs.

559
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,300
There's just one challenge remaining
in the 2016 Great British Bake Off.

560
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,380
In just a few hours, at
a very special picnic,

561
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,100
either Candice, Jane or Andrew
will be crowned this year's winner.

562
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,860
They're making an awful lot of
stuff in their Showstopper, Mary.

563
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,460
An unbelievable amount.

564
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,860
I mean, it's one of the
most exciting Showstoppers

565
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,260
we've ever had.

566
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,860
I know it's very difficult
judge between just three of them

567
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,500
being so close. Let's cut to the chase.

568
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,660
Candice and Jane are very,
very close in the Signature.

569
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,100
Candice went really
overboard with the meringue.

570
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,260
I think it worked, as well.

571
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,700
Likewise, Jane did the perfect pavlova.

572
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,020
And then it all changed again.

573
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Andrew didn't have such a good Signature,

574
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,420
but he came top in Technical.

575
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,380
It was a very good Victoria sandwich.

576
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,140
Paul gave the double Hollywood handshake

577
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,580
to the ladies in the tent.

578
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,220
He gave a single handshake.

579
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,540
There was a single handshake to Candice.

580
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,100
And there was a full double for Jane.

581
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,580
- The Roman clasp?
- I've never...

582
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,180
We've never seen the Roman clasp
before, I don't think, from Paul.

583
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,540
Is this telling us something
about where they're standing

584
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,660
in the pecking order?

585
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,260
- No.
- Right. I'm glad we started with that, then! - Just checking!

586
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,620
Bakers, welcome to your
final Showstopper Challenge.

587
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,500
Paul and Mary would very much like you

588
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,260
to make a picnic fit for Her Majesty.

589
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,700
What we would like you to make is
one chocolate celebration cake,

590
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
which Her Majesty apparently loves.

591
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,660
12 puff-pastry sausage rolls,

592
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,900
12 mini quiches,

593
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,180
12 savoury scones,

594
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,260
and 12 fruit and custard tarts.

595
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,700
That's 49 things altogether each.

596
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,380
You've got 20 minutes. On your marks...

597
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,820
You've got five hours.

598
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,660
- On your marks...
- Get set...

599
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,780
- Good luck, and bake.
- Bake!

600
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,700
Creating a whole range of bakes
for a picnic fit for the Queen...

601
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,620
..is the biggest-ever final
challenge in Bake Off history.

602
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,060
49 little things, all in five hours.

603
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,100
Easy peasy(!)

604
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,260
Keep it together, Andrew...

605
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,860
Five hours seems an awful lot,

606
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,220
but if they don't get
their planning right,

607
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,820
they won't finish on time.

608
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,900
This is batch baking and then some.

609
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,020
All the elements of a picnic
that you can think of.

610
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,900
Every one of those bakes
should be good enough

611
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
to put in front of the Queen.

612
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,620
Each item's got to be consistent.

613
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,220
We want a good finish as
well as good flavours.

614
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,860
I'm expecting perfection.

615
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,300
Pastry...

616
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm doing my pastries first
so I can get them chilling.

617
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,180
I've got my spreadsheet, which...

618
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,260
I've got every five minutes planned
so I know exactly where I am.

619
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,900
I haven't worked out
timings properly on this,

620
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,380
but I think it should be...
I think it should be...

621
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,540
I think it should be fine.

622
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,020
I know the order, I
know I can get it done.

623
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,460
Going to do it.

624
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,580
- Hello, Candice.
- Good morning.

625
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,740
Right. What's going in your hamper, then?

626
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,860
I am doing a chocolate orange
and orange cardamom cake,

627
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,540
then I am doing sausage rolls -

628
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,340
bacon, mushroom, black
pudding. Little piggies,

629
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,060
so it'll have a little
nose, peppercorn eyes,

630
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,700
with crackling curly tails.

631
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,340
To complete her picnic,

632
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,340
Candice is also making
Manchego and olive scones,

633
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,260
salmon and asparagus quiches

634
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
and rhubarb and custard tarts,

635
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,180
all fit for not just a queen,
but pearly kings and queens.

636
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,020
What makes it special for
pearly kings and queens?

637
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,260
It's just a nod to where me
and my dad are from, really.

638
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,740
- Ah, right.
- Cockney, Mary, Cockney. - Cockney.

639
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Candice's journey to the Bake
Off began when she was four,

640
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,260
when her nan, Margaret,
started teaching her to bake.

641
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,780
You always used to like
to wear Nan's glasses.

642
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,620
- Come to that, you used to put Nan's shoes on as well.
- Yep.

643
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,900
My mum was always baking, so Candice
wanted to be in on the action.

644
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,100
I'm so pleased Candice has
achieved this for herself.

645
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I don't think there's any words

646
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,220
that can express how proud we are

647
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,580
as a family.

648
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,420
Candice will go hell for leather
to get whatever she wants.

649
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm extremely proud of Candice.

650
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,660
Regardless if she wins

651
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,020
or whether she loses,

652
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,340
she'll always be a winner in
my eyes and she's my daughter.

653
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,180
This is my puff pastry
for my sausage rolls.

654
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,500
I'm going to do my first turn.

655
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,020
I used to hate making puff,
but I do quite enjoy it now.

656
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,620
It's important to keep it cold

657
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,340
just cos you don't want
the butter to melt.

658
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,260
If it softens up, it means you
won't get those nice, puffy layers.

659
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,460
The sooner the bakers
can prepare the pastry

660
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,900
for their sausage rolls and quiches...

661
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
(Right, next - next, next, next...)

662
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,980
Get that in the fridge.

663
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,500
Half an hour gone already.

664
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,460
What am I doing now? I don't know.

665
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,580
..the sooner they can begin their
show-stopping chocolate cake.

666
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,420
I'm just liquefying my coconut oil.

667
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,700
So rather than using
butter, I'm using oil.

668
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,220
It just makes it nice and moist.

669
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,860
I like adding ground almonds. I
like what it does to the texture

670
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,100
and it just keeps it a
little bit more moist.

671
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,940
My chocolate cake is my
gran's chocolate cake.

672
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,300
It's kind of our
definitive family recipe.

673
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,420
There is a lot riding on this cake,
so...hopefully, I'll do it justice.

674
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,500
Andrew's picnic of family favourites

675
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,580
will also include smoked
Cheddar and paprika scones,

676
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,420
sausage and chorizo jam rolls,

677
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,420
sweet potato, goat's cheese
and caramelised onion quiches

678
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,740
and strawberry and pistachio tarts.

679
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,700
- I call you "the precision baker".
- Right, OK.

680
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,180
It's all about timing. You've...

681
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,140
Oh, right, you've got
an Excel spreadsheet

682
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,940
- to tell you exactly what's going on.
- Yes, I do.

683
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Minute by minute. We're
wasting time right now.

684
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm five minutes behind.

685
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,780
That's every five minutes is planned
so I'm just dashing to the...

686
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah, it says here, actually, that...

687
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,020
Yeah, 9.05, "dash to
fridge". He's on time.

688
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,140
Always a high-flier,

689
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,700
Andrew first discovered
his love of engineering

690
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,620
through his love of cake.

691
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,100
Andrew's always rather
liked chocolate cake

692
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,460
and things and he wanted
to be able to make them.

693
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
Andrew has always been very passionate

694
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,700
about anything he's tackled

695
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,420
and Bake Off is no different.

696
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,180
He's been working full-time

697
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,620
and practising to one
o'clock in the morning.

698
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
He didn't actually go
to his own graduation.

699
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
We went and saw all his friends graduate.

700
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,940
He was baking.

701
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,180
If Andrew takes on any challenge,
he's always put 100% into it.

702
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,340
He's an achiever,

703
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,620
and the success he's had
so far has blown us away.

704
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,900
I absolutely think
Andrew deserves to win.

705
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,940
He's put so much hard work into it

706
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,540
and I hope he does cos
I love him to bits.

707
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,020
He'll hate me saying that!

708
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,980
I'm happy with the
consistency of the cakes.

709
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,700
They've gone in for 15 minutes at 180.

710
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,820
Just making my orange sponge.

711
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,340
This is cardamom and orange

712
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,900
and then I will cover it in an
orange cardamom syrup as well.

713
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,340
Chocolate cake's in the oven.

714
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,580
I've got my puff pastry in the fridge.

715
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,940
I'm just doing sweet
pastry for my fruit tarts.

716
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,700
I mean for this sweet
pastry to be nice and thin,

717
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,060
so about two millimetres.

718
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,260
I want it to be really crisp.
I want Paul to love it.

719
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,660
I don't want to see a
soggy bottom in sight.

720
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,740
I have no idea whether
I'm on schedule or not.

721
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,420
I just have great belief that
if I just keep going today,

722
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,940
if I keep going, it'll all be fine.

723
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,140
Jane's sweetcrust pastry tarts

724
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,980
will be filled with red fruits
and elderflower creme patissiere.

725
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,420
Her picnic will also feature
more of her family's favourites -

726
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,300
butternut squash and Parmesan scones,

727
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,580
apple and thyme sausage rolls,

728
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,220
salmon and dill quiches

729
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,580
and, for her four-tiered chocolate cake,

730
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,060
she's determined to succeed

731
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,300
with a decorative touch

732
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,820
that let her down during botanical week.

733
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,340
It's going to have a
white-chocolate lacy wrap and...

734
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,300
- A collar? You're putting a collar round it?
- Yeah.

735
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,620
- Another collar?
- I know, but it's going to be good this time.

736
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,660
- Victorian lacy collar.
- It's going to be good this time!

737
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,260
Jane has always worked
hard to create great bakes

738
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,460
for her family and friends.

739
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,580
But since the competition,
she's gone to new extremes.

740
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,860
Mum hasn't slept much

741
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,700
for the last 12 weeks.

742
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,140
I'll come down in the morning,
she's there, furiously baking,

743
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
has been awake since five
o'clock in the morning,

744
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,340
there's flour everywhere.

745
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,620
Already, she's made three
different sets of Danish pastries,

746
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,420
a wedding cake, a loaf of bread...

747
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,020
Yeah, she's been a bit obsessed.

748
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,860
Can you believe you're in the final?

749
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,020
I don't actually believe
I'm in that tent.

750
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,980
Mum's amazing at juggling everything.

751
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,980
She's managed to do
everything for Bake Off,

752
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
she's running her own business.

753
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,540
I don't know how she's done it all.

754
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,740
She's always put other people first

755
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,100
and this is the first thing
she's done purely for herself.

756
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,900
I really am very proud of you.

757
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,900
I know everybody thinks it, but
I think I've got the best mum.

758
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,660
Right, the moment of
truth. How's this pastry?

759
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,140
These are my sweet ones.

760
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,500
The pastry has caught on the edges.

761
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,620
"12.02, Sue comes in
and asks inane questions

762
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,940
"about what are you doing" -
what are you doing, Andrew?

763
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,860
I can always trust you
to be on schedule, Sue.

764
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,020
It's lovely.

765
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,620
Everything is important
in the Showstopper.

766
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,900
Absolutely everything.

767
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,820
Right, here we go.

768
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,140
Scones, actually.

769
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,060
Have I put everything in?
Squash, salt and pepper.

770
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,380
Pepper? No, no pepper.

771
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,980
This is my mum and gran's scone recipe,

772
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,820
quite traditional Irish thing,
kind of a soda bread method.

773
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,140
So I'm mixing my flour,
bicarb, some paprika,

774
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,340
buttermilk and some smoked Cheddar.

775
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,300
Handling it as little as possible
is the secret to good scones.

776
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,580
The temptation is to roll it out too far.

777
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,740
Quite a wet dough, so
it's sticking a bit.

778
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
Two-and-a-half hours remaining.

779
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,500
This is my creme patissiere,

780
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,740
which is going to go in my
fruit and custard tarts.

781
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,380
Not sure what the other bakers are doing.

782
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,180
I think they're making
their sausage rolls,

783
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,460
which is what I SHOULD be doing.

784
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,780
With 49 bakes to complete
and only one oven...

785
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,300
I'm going to assemble my
whole sausage roll in one.

786
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,980
Then I can get exactly
the same size piggies.

787
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,660
..time management has never
been harder or more important.

788
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,940
Puff's looking all right.

789
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,140
Yeah, puff's looking...
Puff's looking OK.

790
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,820
The amount of multitasking
required here is mind-blowing.

791
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,140
If I didn't have a plan
right now, I'd be flapping.

792
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,980
Ah!

793
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,340
I am going faster and faster.

794
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,700
I've got so many timers,

795
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,180
I'm not sure what the
timers are for, now.

796
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,860
We are steaming through.

797
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,620
Some of these poor piggies
might be a little cross-eyed.

798
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,260
Give them another...minute or two.

799
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,900
They really haven't risen at all.

800
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,020
They really haven't risen at all.

801
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Outside the tent, the contestants'
friends and family have arrived,

802
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,060
along with a few familiar faces.

803
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,900
I was quite anxious coming here.

804
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,500
Gingerbread falling down,
that was my last experience.

805
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,660
But no, it's really nice,

806
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,540
it's lovely seeing all the bakers again.

807
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,140
It's been really special.

808
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,820
It's really funny being back.

809
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,940
Of course I'd love to be
in the tent right now.

810
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,980
Great to be here, would
LOVE to be in there.

811
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,500
Oh, my gosh, who's going to
win it? Who's going to win it?

812
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,460
Don't ask me that question.

813
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,540
Candice.

814
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,660
She plans well, she's impeccable,
and she is so focused.

815
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,380
I've been backing Jane since week one.

816
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,180
I want Andrew to win...

817
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,820
..but it'll be a tough call,

818
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,780
cos the girls have
been very, very strong.

819
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,340
You know, Candice has been
Star Baker so many times

820
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,580
and Andrew and Jane have both
been so consistent - oh...!

821
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,100
I think I'm going to have to say Jane.

822
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,700
OK, finalists, you've got an
hour left of your Showstoppers.

823
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,180
One hour left.

824
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,700
Right, calm down, now.

825
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,380
I have got my collar and the
decoration to do on this.

826
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,580
I've got assembly of
the fruit tarts to do.

827
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,500
I've still got to bake my quiches.

828
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,420
So, um...quite a lot to get done, really.

829
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:25,740
I'm just melting my chocolate
for my chocolate icing

830
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,020
and just waiting for my
sausage rolls to cook.

831
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm ashamed of myself for
not measuring out the pastry.

832
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,340
But got to get these
sausage rolls finished,

833
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,780
so...screw the measurements.

834
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,860
Is that pastry too thick?

835
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,380
I don't know.

836
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,220
Asparagus going into the
coffin there, lovely.

837
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,740
Just left it a little
bit too long in the oven.

838
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm going to put some foil over the top.

839
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,660
Should hopefully stop
them browning too much.

840
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,140
OK, picnickers, you don't want
to keep a good wasp waiting.

841
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,820
You've got half an hour
to finish, half an hour.

842
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm going to have to do
the chocolate collar now.

843
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,820
It's a very simple and easy
chocolate collar this time.

844
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,820
Got to try and chill that somehow.

845
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,700
Are you all right, Jane?

846
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,500
I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

847
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,100
OK. I've caught the edges of these.

848
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,620
So this is my sugar glaze.

849
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,980
It just makes it look
shiny and nice, really.

850
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,500
Right. One, two, three...

851
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,180
You can't leave it in there very long,

852
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,900
otherwise it won't be flexible at all.

853
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,140
One, two, three, four...

854
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,020
Those need at least an extra five.

855
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,260
Those are going to come out very hot.

856
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,380
Oh, stick, damn you, stick!

857
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,500
- (That's good.)
- Ooh, look at the rise on those!

858
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,060
OK, ladies and gent, I
have no wish to HAMPER you,

859
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,980
but you have five minutes left
on your final Showstoppers.

860
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,100
Ah...!

861
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,620
It's not doing it! It's not coming off!

862
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,140
I have a minor disaster here.

863
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,740
My chocolate collar,

864
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,420
I over...over-chilled it.

865
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,100
And it doesn't want to come off.

866
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,940
I don't quite know what
I'm going to do about that.

867
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,980
OK, little piggies need to
put things in the hamper,

868
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,740
little piggies need to
stop in two minutes.

869
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,220
These are the sausage rules.

870
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,780
My collar is not to be. What a pity.

871
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,180
Oh, if in doubt, throw some
glitter at it, I always say.

872
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,620
OK, bakers, five hours is up.

873
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,460
You can do no more.

874
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,500
- You've finished!
- Wahey, well done!

875
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,740
Oh, well done, guys, well done!

876
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,220
My God.

877
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,500
That was mad.

878
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,060
I honestly don't know if
I've done enough to win.

879
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,420
It'll all come down to the
quality of the pastry and flavours

880
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,700
and you can't tell that
from looking at them.

881
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,060
I will always see the negatives,
always see the bits I don't like,

882
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,860
always think everybody
else's is better, but...

883
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,420
...I have just...I have given it...

884
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,740
I've given everything.

885
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,660
I think I could cry.

886
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,140
I think it's just the
emotion of finishing

887
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,660
and not doing it again.

888
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,900
I think that's really sad.

889
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,020
I'll really miss it.
I've loved every minute.

890
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm going to just wipe my eyes now.

891
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,100
Cos I'm not going to cry.

892
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,500
But it's been great.

893
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,580
Jane, do you want a hand
with your hamper goods?

894
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,500
I'm sure the Queen would love
this colourful selection,

895
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
and it does look right royal and regal.

896
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,660
Thank you. Thank you very much.

897
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,620
So let's start with the sausage roll.

898
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,660
You've got some issues with
raw pastry inside here.

899
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,700
Oh, is it?

900
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,060
- You see the layers?
- Oh, yes.

901
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,700
It hasn't baked all the way through.

902
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,100
- But the flavour... Tastes delicious.
- Thank you.

903
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,700
This is the tart.

904
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,060
Pale, but baked.

905
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,340
Nice and crispy.

906
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,860
It looks absolutely cram-jam
full of salmon and prawn.

907
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,020
Mmm. It's very, very good.

908
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,420
Right - scone.

909
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,900
To me, with my eyes shut,

910
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,860
it tastes like a rather
good cheese scone.

911
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,340
I don't actually taste
the butternut squash.

912
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,580
Which is a shame. It
would've been nice to get

913
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,780
something with a little
bit more kick in it.

914
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,940
These tarts - the decoration
on the top is so pretty,

915
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,140
you couldn't resist picking those up.

916
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,660
You've managed to keep that
pastry beautifully crisp.

917
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,740
The creme pat has held and none
of it is dripping down the side.

918
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,140
The flavour's good.

919
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,460
Right. We'll move on to your cake.

920
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,020
It isn't what you planned, your
band, but you didn't panic.

921
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,060
You've done it.

922
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,620
Now, that's a lovely surprise
in the middle, there.

923
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,380
- Great chocolate cake.
- Thank you.

924
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,180
- Tastes beautiful. It's light...
- Thank you. - Soft...

925
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,860
And then with that cream in the middle,

926
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,540
with the kick from the cherries...

927
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,220
That's beautiful. It's a
shame about the collar.

928
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,300
Andrew.

929
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,660
It is beautifully displayed.

930
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,060
Very meticulous, just like you.

931
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,940
Everything we've seen
has been very calculated

932
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,660
and beautifully presented.

933
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,700
Right, we'll start with the sausage roll.

934
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,180
Let's have a quick cut.

935
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,620
It's not done here.

936
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,740
Yeah.

937
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,780
The taste of that sausage is fantastic.

938
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,180
Beautiful sausages,

939
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,020
but it's such a thick layer
of undercooked pastry.

940
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,620
I think I'd be leaving that.

941
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,380
Scone.

942
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,100
I think the colour and the
look of them is most exciting,

943
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,020
but the flavour just isn't there.

944
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,380
I'm trying to find the
cheese. I've got the paprika.

945
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,620
I'm not getting it at all.

946
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,180
Let's try the quiche.

947
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,860
Nice colour. It's nice and neat
all the way round, as well.

948
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,900
Looks like it's been
professionally blocked.

949
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,300
- Crispy.
- That's the right thickness of pastry.

950
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,340
The flavour of that is delicious.

951
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,820
OK.

952
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,220
However, you probably worked that
pastry a little bit too much.

953
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,500
That should just fall apart.

954
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,740
Let's try the strawberry tart.

955
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,580
Now, obviously, straightaway,
there is an issue with this.

956
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,740
- Yeah.
- I daren't even lift it.

957
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,380
I know it's going to be soggy underneath.

958
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,820
Well, it's basically raw underneath

959
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,740
because everything's soaked
in to that blind-baked pastry.

960
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,900
Actually, it tastes good.

961
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,620
I think the problem is, when
you put the sugar syrup on it,

962
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,340
it's soaked into the side of the pastry

963
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,020
and so the whole thing just collapsed.

964
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,700
OK. Let's have a look at this cake.

965
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,540
- Those shards are beautiful on top.
- Cuts great.

966
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,580
You said this was your grandma's recipe?

967
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,620
Yes.

968
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,340
That's a great cake.

969
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,020
That's a really nice cake.

970
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,780
She'll be very pleased to hear that.

971
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,780
The ganache keeps it moist.

972
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,740
It's a very, very good chocolate cake.

973
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,620
I think that's the
star piece in all this.

974
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,900
- I'd have the cake any day.
- OK.

975
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,340
Thank you.

976
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,580
It looks an exciting
hamper. Lots of colour.

977
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,020
I love your little piggies looking at me.

978
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,260
I'm dying to get into them.

979
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,700
- That's its mouth, I take it?
- Yeah.

980
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,060
- Nose, eyes...
- Yeah. - Yeah, OK. - And its little crispy tail.

981
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,460
Love crackling. Right...

982
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,380
Mmm...

983
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,340
That's a good puff pastry.

984
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,220
Nice flaky layers.

985
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,020
Unusual, with the black pudding.

986
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,300
I think they're great. I
think the flavour's fantastic.

987
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,700
And you've got beautiful layers.

988
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,580
- Thank you.
- OK. Shall we move on to the quiche?

989
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,940
Ooh, yeah. Crispy all
the way. Sides, bottom...

990
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,340
It's full, that, Mary, isn't it?

991
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,900
What I like is it's not all
sort of custardy filling.

992
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
We've got lots of salmon in here.

993
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
That's a good quiche. And it tastes good.

994
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,900
- Thank you.
- And the pastry's in nice layers.

995
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,380
It is. It's well baked.

996
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,100
Right, scone.

997
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,020
Nice colour on the top, nice size.

998
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,220
I can't taste the cheese.

999
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,740
- OK.
- Manchego's strong.

1000
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,140
The problem is, olives are SO strong.

1001
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,460
- I can taste the olive but I didn't get the cheese.
- OK.

1002
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,180
Let's look at these
raspberry and rhubarb tarts.

1003
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,220
They look attractive, and nice
to do it in a brioche tin,

1004
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,220
rather than the conventional tin.

1005
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,100
That's a good custard.

1006
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,420
- Thank you.
- Rhubarb, you're very brave to put it in,

1007
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,380
because there's so much moisture,

1008
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,980
and in no way is that
soaking into the pastry,

1009
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
the pastry is still crisp.

1010
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,660
- It's a little over-baked.
- Yeah.

1011
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,860
But the whole flavour is very, very good.

1012
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,580
Let's try the chocolate.

1013
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,060
That's a lovely cake.

1014
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,820
The oil works well in it,

1015
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,500
and the flavour of the orange
comes through beautifully as well.

1016
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,620
Delicious orange.

1017
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,700
You've got the right amount of ganache,

1018
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,300
and I like the finish, as well.

1019
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,860
I think that would be a great
cake to take on a picnic.

1020
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,980
- Thank you very much.
- No, thank you. Thank you very much.

1021
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,060
It's you two.

1022
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,020
- No, no.
- It is!

1023
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,900
As Candice, Andrew and Jane
join their family and friends...

1024
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,740
..Mary and Paul have a
huge decision to make.

1025
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,420
Well, this was an absolute
humdinger of a Showstopper.

1026
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,740
The standard was exceptionally high.

1027
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,100
Andrew's chocolate cake
was out of this world.

1028
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,780
It had a beautiful texture, flavour.

1029
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,100
But the fruit tart -
it was falling apart.

1030
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,020
And the scones - no flavour.

1031
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,100
Then you have Candice, who
is this very creative baker.

1032
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,740
Everything packed with flavour.

1033
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,780
Now, when you look at the actual quiche,

1034
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,700
she put loads and loads
of salmon in there,

1035
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,420
but it did taste extremely good.

1036
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,540
Her sausage rolls...

1037
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,740
I've had many sausage rolls in my time.

1038
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,780
- I bet you have.
- And to make a little pig out of one...

1039
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,140
They were different, and
the pastry was good, too.

1040
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,820
- It's a sensational cake, isn't it?
- That orange!

1041
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,660
And it was so soft inside. Great cake.

1042
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,020
I like Jane because she
is a true family cook.

1043
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,820
Her prawn quiche was
absolutely delicious.

1044
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,260
I thought the fruit tart tasted great.

1045
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,100
The sausage roll was slightly underdone.

1046
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,380
Paul and Mary, the big
question is...who's won?

1047
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,540
I've sort of made up my mind.

1048
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,020
I've had a thought myself,

1049
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,660
but I want to confirm it with Paul.

1050
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,980
That seems reasonable, bearing
in mind you're the judges.

1051
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,540
We shall leave now.

1052
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,220
Finalists, what
incredible bakers you are!

1053
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,540
Would the three of you step up, please?

1054
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,020
- MEL:
- Oh, Jane... Jane's gone!

1055
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,940
Jane, Andrew, Candice,

1056
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,340
Mary and Paul have decided,
after a lot of deliberation,

1057
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,900
that the winner of The
Great British Bake Off 2016

1058
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,100
is...

1059
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,580
..Candice!

1060
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,820
- Well done!
- Well done, Candice!

1061
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,540
Well done!

1062
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,660
Well done, sweetheart.

1063
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,100
Never, ever, ever thought
I'd ever even get on this,

1064
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:14,380
and I'm standing here now with
this, and they said my name,

1065
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,620
and that means more to me

1066
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,660
than I think anyone
will ever, ever realise.

1067
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,780
It really, really does.

1068
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,420
Well deserved!

1069
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,140
Her determination and passion...

1070
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,860
She really has excelled.

1071
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,180
Had wonderful flavours, and
everything always looked gorgeous.

1072
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,500
Candice is very much all or nothing.

1073
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,660
When you look back on some of her bakes,

1074
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,100
they've been beautiful.

1075
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,700
When she nails it, she's one of the best.

1076
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,460
Come over!

1077
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,700
Oh, my God!

1078
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,860
Candice has been fantastic throughout.

1079
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,420
'I'm chuffed to bits for her.'

1080
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,500
You deserve it, Candice. Well, well done.

1081
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,620
Of course I'm a little
disappointed, but actually,

1082
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,500
to be able to walk out there at the
end with the hamper, see everyone...

1083
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,060
Yeah, it's really special.

1084
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,780
Oh, you star! Well done!

1085
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,660
'The best baker today won.
I'm really happy for her.

1086
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,580
'Week after week, Candice
has got better and better.'

1087
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,860
I predicted it!

1088
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,820
So my first prediction of
the series has come true...

1089
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,860
dammit!

1090
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:37,860
Em... I saw, and I wished,
and I hoped it was OK,

1091
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,460
but you just don't know.

1092
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,980
Jane and Andrew are so good, so good.

1093
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,340
She's done so well. She's
been an absolute star.

1094
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,340
I did it! I'm good.

1095
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,100
I'm good enough.

1096
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,060

1097
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,380

1098
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,980
Thank you. Like...

1099
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,900
Oh, my God! What an opportunity.

1100
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,500
Amazing! I don't know what else to say.

1101
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,580
- She did smash it.
- She did smash it.
