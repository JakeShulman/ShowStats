1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Week five, halfway through, and the tension is mounting.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,240
- Time to do some yoga. 
- Oh, what's that move?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
- It's a Battenberg in repose.
- Gosh. I always like the downward baguette.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,040
BOTH: Welcome to The Great British Bake Off.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,880
- Last time...
- They're humongous!

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,440
- ..batter.
- Don't look at these.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,880
These are not the Yorkshires you're looking for.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,480
An epic tale of the rise and fall of puddings.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
- They're going in the bin. 
- But after over-frying her bunnies...

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,480
Oh! I might have mucked them up.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,400
..Kate became the fourth baker to leave the tent.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
- I feel really guilty.
- No, it's fine. I had a shocking week.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,440
- Tossing the perfect pancake...
- They are very nice, aren't they?
- Yes.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,120
- ..and standout churros...
- Thank you, Benjamina.
- You've cracked it.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,680
..gave Benjamina her first Star Baker crown.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,280
- This time... 
- # It's getting hot in here. #

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,600
..it's pastry.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,680
- One down, a million processes to go.
- A Danish classic...

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,920
- Time is running out.
- ..a technical tart...
- This is a disaster.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,080
- ..and an amusing... 
- Like a pizza.
- ..filo Showstopper.

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,080
- I was so calm earlier. 
- Oh, my word, the oven wasn't on.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,640
Great to have reached week five.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,240
Having got this far,

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,920
I really want to get to the end now.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm a friendly kind of competitive.

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,520
I would love to get Star Baker before I leave the tent,

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,480
which hopefully won't be for a while.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,960
'Having won Star Baker last week,'

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,600
I think it does add a little bit of pressure because you don't

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,280
want to go from the top and then just crash all the way down.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,400
'Last week was such a disaster that sometimes I just think,'

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
"Am I worthy of being here?"

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
'When you see the tent,'

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,160
just occasionally you think of turning around and going home.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,360
And then you think, "No! You've got so much to do and share,

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,080
"get on in, get it done."

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,360
Morning, bakers. It is pastry week.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
Paul and Mary would love you, please,

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,080
for this Signature Challenge, to make 24 breakfast pastries.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
We would like you to make two different types, that's 12 of each, and they must be Danish pastries.

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,080
Fill them, glaze them, make them look as dainty and beautiful

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,880
as Paul's weekend alter ego.

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,200
You've got three and a half hours on this challenge.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
- On your marks...
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake.

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Breakfast pastries, we all love them, but they mustn't forget

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
the actual dough has a high proportion of butter

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
and, if it melts out, the breakfast pastry is as dry as old boots.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
It's all about time management.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,640
They've got to get that dough ready as quickly as possible.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,080
Then the filling's prepared while the dough's resting

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,440
and then, finally, prove the pastry once they've shaped it.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,480
Speed in the early stages of their Signature Bake is crucial.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,000
I've got half of my dough on my foot.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,880
The bakers need their basic Danish pastry dough to begin its

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,960
first proving as soon as possible.

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,720
It's related to puff pastry but it's much more enriched,

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
so it's got eggs and sugar and, importantly, yeast.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,240
The pastry is kind of in-between strength and weakness,

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,760
it's not one of the best things I do.

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,440
For speed, last week's Star Baker, Benjamina, is making one large

61
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,800
batch of dough for both her breakfast pastries.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
A peanut butter and banana pinwheel

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,720
and a pecan swirl with maple syrup and candied bacon.

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,360
I've actually just made up the enriched dough and it's now

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
in the fridge chilling and proving.

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,800
I really need to be good with my time on this one.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,840
While the rest of the bakers race to start their first prove...

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,360
It's a little bit wetter than I usually make it,

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,800
but it's better to be wetter than it is to be dry.

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,040
..one baker has decided to make the start

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
of this Signature Bake twice as hard.

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,720
You're making two separate doughs,

73
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,560
you're making double work for yourself.

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Jane's first dough is for her orange and cardamom pain au raisins.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,360
She's also making chocolate and almond Danish pastries

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,440
with a dough flavoured with cinnamon.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,480
I did start making one type with just the orange and then thought,

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,840
"Well, if I'm going to do it in two different lots,

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,680
"I might as well do two different doughs."

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,880
With their dough proving,

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,240
the bakers need to quickly prepare the breakfast pastries'

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
other crucial components -

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,080
huge quantities of butter.

84
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,920
The butter needs to be flat, so that it can be folded into the dough.

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,800
My neck and my shoulders are quite sore this week.

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,280
I'm not sure whether it's pastry-induced...

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,720
As well as an apple and cinnamon Danish,

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,760
Candice's love of French food has meant she's the only baker

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,920
attempting a savoury breakfast pastry based on a croque-monsieur,

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,160
with mushrooms and pancetta.

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
You've got a bunch of thyme there, what's that?

92
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,920
The thyme's going with the mushrooms,

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
white sauce and a Gruyere.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,400
Gruyere's a good choice for cheese in the way it bakes in a pastry.

95
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Now, the butter that you're putting in,

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
what's the proportion of butter to the dough?

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,200
Half the amount of butter to the pastry.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,040
How are you going to stop the butter from bleeding out while it's baking?

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm trying to keep the butter really cool,

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,320
so I'm bashing it out now while my dough rests

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,480
and then, when it's thin and bashed out, I'm putting it in the fridge.

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,600
- Thank you very much, Candice. 
- We'll leave you to bash your butter.

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,880
Thank you very much.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,120
Andrew is going a little further than just bashing.

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
Of course I'm measuring my butter.

106
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,040
I've got to maintain a reputation as a reputable engineer.

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,560
Andrew is precisely engineering pastries featuring his mum

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,280
and dad's favourite fillings -

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,640
pear and chocolate pinwheel for Mum

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,320
and spiced date swirls for his dad.

111
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,960
My dad always used to have dates in the glove box of the car when

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,200
we were kids - I remember we used to snack away on them.

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,320
I like to get nice, neat corners on the butter -

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,960
if that means a little bit of hand fudging, that's fine with me.

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,640
So, I'm going to get that in the fridge.

116
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,880
Every minute the butter chills and the dough proves...

117
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,000
- Five minutes.
- ..should be used to prepare the Danish pastries'

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,440
- signature fillings. 
- OK, now time to chop some fruits.

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,760
I grew up in Ghana, we had lots of mangoes, pineapple

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,640
and coconuts, so, yeah, let's call it a Ghanaian pastry.

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,760
Selasi's transporting himself back to his childhood

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,600
with a pineapple and coconut lattice

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
and a pinwheel filled with mango, ginger and rhubarb.

124
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,040
- It's an unusual combination.
- Yes.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
What sort of glazes are you having?

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,840
So the ginger and mango will have the orange and ginger glaze,

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
coconut and pineapple will have a pineapple glaze,

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,680
and then they'll have a lemon and lime drizzle.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,280
These sound amazing in flavours. Be careful of the texture of the

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
coconut though, that it doesn't destroy it.

131
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,800
- We'll love you and leave you. 
- That's to go.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,920
- Thanks, buddy.
- That's all right.

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,040
The bakers now face the toughest bit of multitasking

134
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
that they've experienced so far.

135
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,600
- Get a good banana flavour. 
- Whilst making their fillings...

136
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,080
Get it nice and crispy.

137
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,600
..they also have to begin the vital process of pastry lamination...

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Oh, you're on your folds already?

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,840
- Oh, my God.
- ..layering their chilled butter between their proved dough.

140
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,880
Maybe I'm rushing. This is my second dough.

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,320
If I've measured this right,

142
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,720
this should cover two thirds of my pastry.

143
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,280
It's not how it should be, but, oh, well.

144
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,400
It's important that no butter comes through,

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,680
- so I'm just going to pinch it together.
- Seal the edges.

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
So, I've just done a standard envelope fold,

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,480
so like you would fold a letter.

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm doing a book turn, which is probably different to what

149
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,000
a lot of the other bakers are doing, but I get more layers quicker.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
There.

151
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,160
One down, a million processes to go.

152
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm going to cook the apple and I'm using oranges and lemons,

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,640
and it absolutely lifts the apple.

154
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,160
Val needs to find the time to perfect her pecan and maple syrup

155
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,520
pinwheels, as well as her apple and sultana-topped cinnamon swirls.

156
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,920
You're doing a cinnamon swirl and you're going to top it with apple,

157
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,120
so it's not in it then?

158
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,760
It's on it. So I use a spoon and make a little well in it,

159
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,280
- so the apple sits in the middle. 
- Does it not fall off?

160
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,600
- No, it doesn't.
- Well, it's sort of in it as well as on it.

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,960
- In it and on it. And I have my secret weapon with me.
- Oh, hello.

162
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,480
- Dental floss.
- What on earth are you going to do with that?

163
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,680
You have your dough, and then you make a loop and you pull it.

164
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
You get a nice, clean cut.

165
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,440
- You're the first person we've had who's flossed her pastry.
- Yes.

166
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,840
I want the judges to be able to taste each element.

167
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,400
There's some ground ginger, cinnamon and some nutmeg in there

168
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,520
and I don't want it to kind of overwhelm the Danish,

169
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,120
because that's happened in the past with my bread and Mary didn't

170
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,880
appreciate the amount of chilli that I put in there.

171
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,160
Rav's banking on a classic pecan, walnut and maple plait

172
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,360
and cinnamon swirls with simple lemon icing.

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,800
I hope they're not too disappointed that I haven't been too

174
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,400
creative with my flavours.

175
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,440
This is my second turn,

176
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,760
so I'm getting this out to 50 by 20 centimetres.

177
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
The butter has broken up a little bit, which is interesting.

178
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
We'll go with it.

179
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, we've got butter. Put some flour on there

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,440
cos you do not want your butter leaking out or it's going to

181
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,760
ruin your layers.

182
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,120
There should be 27 layers, so I think three turns,

183
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,520
but I get confused.

184
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,560
There is a formula to work out how many layers you'll get.

185
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
Layers of lamination equals F,

186
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,760
which I think is the number of folds,

187
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,880
plus one to the power of how many times you turn.

188
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
That'll give you the layers.

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
I've got three at the moment,

190
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,080
so, when I fold it again, I'll have nine. I can do three times three.

191
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Third one will be 27.

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,000
I've done another book turn,

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,560
which is where I'll get four times that many layers.

194
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,880
Benjamina, that's two. How's your bacon?

195
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,760
Oh, no. I need some more bacon.

196
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
Little bit annoyed. I was ahead when I put it in.

197
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,000
Just putting in my pancetta,

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,640
can't really beat bacon and mushroom for breakfast.

199
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,880
But the flavours could be good and the pastry could be rubbish.

200
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,680
- HE SINGS:
- Da-da-da.
- Tom's breakfast choices are a little healthier.

201
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
I want this quite crisp

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,120
because it's going to get some moisture

203
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,840
from the cooking pastry anyway.

204
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,920
Tom's granola will be rolled into his spirals and he's making

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,800
square turnovers filled with creme patissiere,

206
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
blended with another almost-healthy option.

207
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Wheat biscuits with creme pat?

208
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Now, that's going to be very different.

209
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,840
The flavour's quite similar to when you get to the end of your

210
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,400
bowl of cereal and you drink the milk, but I've added a bit of

211
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,680
vanilla to this, just to make it a little bit more classic as well.

212
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,000
OK, sounds interesting.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,680
As you say in the breakfast cereal world, Cheerio.

214
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm leaving the tent guys, it's been really great.

215
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
This is my final turn.

216
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm just squashing down to try and get the butter a bit even.

217
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
Going to do another book turn now, so I should get even more layers.

218
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
One hour remaining to make 24 Danish pastries.

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
# Doo-bee-doo-be-doop-doop. #

220
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
In order to give the pastry the maximum time to rest...

221
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
I've only got two minutes till something happens, so...

222
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,840
You've got two minutes and 24 seconds, actually.

223
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,200
..the bakers should leave shaping and filling

224
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,720
until the last possible minute.

225
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,560
So, these will be my apple roses.

226
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,920
But every minute they aren't shaping and filling...

227
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,760
Now, dough, just make sure that's all right.

228
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,960
..is a minute they won't have for baking.

229
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,080
- 50 minutes.
- How many?
- 5-0.
- 5-0, OK.

230
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm pretty pleased with how the pastry's come out.

231
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm making the pinwheels. You get a beautiful, crisp point,

232
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,840
but the middle will be nice and soft.

233
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Success second time round.

234
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
I kept an eye on it, I watched it like a hawk.

235
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
Somehow, time has escaped me.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,800
- It looks like origami. 
- It does look like origami.

237
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
You fold it over, so you end up with a little...

238
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
Hang on, you've totally lost me there already.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
Just take one side over underneath, the other side over the top and

240
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,280
then I'm just going to put the bechamel on top in the gap.

241
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,560
Would you call that a little lattice or a...?

242
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
I have no idea what you'd call it, really.

243
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,600
- Jane's open pocket. Jane's... 
- Yeah, my kids have discovered that.

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
- MEL LAUGHS 
- Yeah, I bet they have.

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,240
Should have an hour of proving.

246
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,880
Bless them, they're going to have ten minutes.

247
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,200
I don't actually know if Paul likes peanut butter,

248
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,920
he didn't say he disliked it.

249
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
I just want to make sure I get it edge to edge

250
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,560
cos I don't want any gaps.

251
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
Want to make sure I don't coil it too tight

252
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,080
cos I want to give it room to grow.

253
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

254
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,520
- Might even get a bonus one out. 
- How's the pastry flossing going?

255
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,480
- Immensely clean. 
- Have you found any cavities or...

256
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,760
- Um...
- ..all clear?
- All clear.

257
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, it does work, doesn't it?

258
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
It's not too badly compressing the layers together,

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
so hopefully I'll still get that lamination.

260
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
Can you have too much chocolate filling? Possibly not.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm just going to have to do the other ones really quickly.

262
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,920
Bakers, just 30 minutes left for grievous BUTTERLY harm.

263
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,160
- Just 30 minutes. 
- Time is running out.

264
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,080
You're not going to plait all those bits, are you?

265
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
- This is what I do, I fold it over like this.
- I know what it is -

266
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
it's a plattice.

267
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,520
It's a half plait, half lattice.

268
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,960
It's a little bit like a pastry cigar, isn't it?

269
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,920
That'll do.

270
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,400
Cool, next one.

271
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,680
My frangipane's melting and escaping.

272
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,760
They're looking a bit messy in there.

273
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,320
- Candice, I don't in any way want to alarm you...
- Hmm?

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,520
23 minutes to go.

275
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,560
- Thank very much.
- OK? Just to put that into perspective.

276
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,520
One more minute, pushing it.

277
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,040
- How long do they need in the oven? 
- 20 minutes.

278
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,720
20 minutes. OK, you're fine.

279
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
That gives you three minutes to play with.

280
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,680
- Hello, darling.
- Hello. 
- How many have you got to do?

281
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,360
A lot. I've still got 12 that are raw, I've got 12 in the oven.

282
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,520
- 12 that are raw?! 
- 12 that aren't cooked yet.

283
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,800
- OK, and how long do they need? 
- About 20 minutes.

284
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,400
- OK, you've got about 20 minutes. 
- Yeah.

285
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,360
They're going in...I think...

286
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,600
although I have no space.

287
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
Upper bunk looking good.

288
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,000
Lower bunk also looking good.

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm going to put three trays in, just so I get something.

290
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,080
I just spilt cheese everywhere.

291
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,920
They are in.

292
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,320
It's the usual position, sat in front of the oven, praying.

293
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,600
Cook faster, please.

294
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
- How's it going, Candice? 
- Well, they're in.

295
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,840
Overdone. The others aren't cooked though, that's the problem.

296
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,240
How much longer have we got?

297
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,720
OK, bakers, you've got five minutes for your Danish to make a killing.

298
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh, we're going to be tight on this.

299
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,920
They're not going to be cooked. They're not going to be cooked.

300
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,160
I've only got 11 in there, I've just realised. That's left over.

301
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
So...fun times ahead.

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Coming out.

303
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Have not got time.

304
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,880
Oh, the butter is not even for real right now. Leaking everywhere.

305
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, dear.

306
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,120
- OK, bakers, this Danish saga is over.
- There you go, 12.

307
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,760
- I'm shaking.
- Oh, please, God.

308
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Fire!

309
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,600
I think someone put some butter in the bottom of my oven.

310
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,920
- So, Val, have we got 12? 
- Yes, 12 of each.

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,440
What we'll do is we'll start with the pinwheel.

312
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,120
The bake underneath looks a bit pale. Let's have a quick look.

313
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,880
You've got a little bit of a flake, it's gone a bit doughy there

314
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,920
where you put the filling, but that's quite normal.

315
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,040
They're a very good buttery flavour,

316
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,800
but they're a little bit underdone underneath.

317
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,920
I actually like them a little bit softer in the middle.

318
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,080
- Really? 
- Yes, it's how our family like them,

319
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,400
they like them a bit softer in the middle.

320
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,880
The problem is, when you push a hole in the middle, it falls through.

321
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,960
I was too energetic today, I thought,

322
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,040
"Oh, bother, I pushed right through."

323
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,520
That apple, you've just got the right amount of spice,

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,600
but sad that it all falls apart.

325
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,720
They're a lovely inviting colour, but, if you look in here,

326
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
it's not quite done.

327
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,800
I don't know that the rhubarb adds to the mango.

328
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm not really getting a lot of ginger coming through,

329
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,800
but I'm certainly not getting the almond.

330
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,280
Well done for using fresh pineapple and fresh coconut,

331
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
- the flavours really come through. 
- Thank you.

332
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,760
This is going to be fascinating.

333
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Dry as a bone. With granola on top of that, wow.

334
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,640
A pastry should be buttery when you taste it

335
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,360
and the butter's gone. Absolutely raw layers all the way through.

336
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,040
- Do you know what? I'm not going to. 
- It's fine.

337
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,200
It's such a shame.

338
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,040
I think the overall plaiting looks good.

339
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,960
I think the colour's OK. How many have you got of these?

340
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,720
- Um, 12 of the cinnamon swirls.
- Yeah.

341
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,520
- 11 of the...
- 11 plaits. 
- There's 11 plaits.

342
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,320
They're bone dry,

343
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,080
so what you're left with is a bread with some bits in it.

344
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
Can't get any flavour from them.

345
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
The nut filling in there...

346
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,720
- ..is delicious.
- OK.

347
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,600
If my dad had kept

348
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,120
dates in our glove box, there would have been uproar.

349
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
In 1970s Leatherhead, there would have been uproar.

350
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,240
Good lamination all the way through,

351
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,000
you can't see any gaps in there at all.

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,640
Immensely tempting, beautiful colour.

353
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,520
These look more biscuit-y because they've been cut very thinly.

354
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,560
Hm. You'd want a bit of height in the Danish itself.

355
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
Unbearable silence.

356
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,080
For me, the flavour is very good, but it's just all too close.

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,520
If it was thicker, you would have had a proper Danish pastry.

358
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,480
You got away with it. Right, it's a lovely colour on the top.

359
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,560
That pear and the creme patissiere, absolutely delicious.

360
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,320
Pear and creme pat are beautiful together, the chocolate's just

361
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,400
overwhelmed it for me. And it is too thin - you need to have it thicker.

362
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,840
Apart from that, perfect.

363
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,120
- Thank you.
- Absolutely perfect. 
- Thanks.

364
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Did you prove these

365
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,880
before they went in the oven?

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,680
I actually didn't have time to prove them.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,920
That's why they've ended up like that. It hasn't grown,

368
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,560
you pop them into a hot oven, the yeast will explode and then throw

369
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,760
all the butter out, which is exactly what's happened.

370
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,040
Did you notice that, on the tray, there was butter?

371
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,640
- Oh, yeah, there was lots. 
- Sadly, it is raw in the middle.

372
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,280
- Didn't give yourself enough time and it was all rushed.
- Hm.

373
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Ha.

374
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,680
The banana and the peanut is just mad.

375
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
- Mad - good?
- I do like it.
- OK.

376
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,840
I've just never had anything like it before. It's bizarre.

377
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,880
I think it works in a Danish, if it was baked properly.

378
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
- Maple and the bacon.
- And the bacon.

379
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,520
Again, quite raw. All the butter's just left.

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,160
Lovely colour around the outside, you've got a nice bit of depth.

381
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Great flavour, really is beautiful.

382
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,720
That's a shame. I think both your fillings are beautiful,

383
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,320
but your pastry needs a lot of work.

384
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,160
- Yeah.
- Who was Star Baker last week? 
- Benjamina.

385
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
I don't know, was it?

386
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,880
- That's the ideal pastry right there. 
- Can you eat that one then, please?

387
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,040
Um... All of these, love the colour and, actually the lamination looks

388
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,480
pretty good as well, but you've overfilled them.

389
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
Yes, I did.

390
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,200
That is how I'd expect it to look inside.

391
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,720
Quite irregular, you can see the lamination,

392
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,520
it's baked all the way through.

393
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,040
Gosh, you've got the flavour right, it's delicious.

394
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,360
You've got very good distribution of the fruit -

395
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,600
orange is definitely coming through beautifully.

396
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
Let's have a look at this.

397
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,280
Good bake, nice and brown underneath, crispy as well.

398
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,520
- I think the flavour is delicious. 
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

399
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,040
- You've shown us that you can make a very good pastry.
- Thank you.

400
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,000
The savoury ones look pretty good - nice shape.

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,200
You've lost a little bit of butter out of there

402
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,160
but, actually, it's well-baked all the way through.

403
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,200
- I think the flavour of the filling's delicious.
- Thank you.

404
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,560
However, the pastry itself is very dry...

405
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,840
- OK.
- ..and that's because you rushed it and the butter's poured out.

406
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,800
Right, let's try these sweet ones.

407
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,280
How pretty these are, a very original formation of the apple.

408
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,960
These are absolutely delicious.

409
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,200
Beautifully crispy, it's so pretty on the top.

410
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm dying to have it, but it's a pity it's not quite done.

411
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Yeah, I just needed a little bit longer.

412
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,360
Could you explain to me why you have a pile of six?

413
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm just taking them home for my family.

414
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,400
- That is absolutely fine. 
- The family...

415
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,880
Do you not get fed at home?

416
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
- Well, they'll love these. Is that all right?
- Of course it is.

417
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,440
- I've depleted your basket, sorry. 
- Thank you, Candice.

418
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,800
- You're very welcome. Thank you. 
- Will you please leave?

419
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,360
They love a savoury puff, I'm sorry.

420
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,240
'I'm really glad I took that gamble with the savoury.'

421
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,800
A little bit weird paid off, maybe.

422
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,520
'Better than I dared to hope for.'

423
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,960
Mary's comments were lovely, Paul's comments were...astounding.

424
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,360
Slightly disappointed, if I'm honest,

425
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,320
especially at something that would have been really easy to change if

426
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,640
I'd have known about the thickness of them.

427
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
'Saying that the pastry's raw'

428
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,800
probably is the worst thing they could say,

429
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,320
that it's not even cooked.

430
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,600
But they did eat it, so it wasn't that raw.

431
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
I'd like to pretend that I can draw a line under it -

432
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,560
I probably won't. I'll probably go away and brood for a little while.

433
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm not looking forward to the technical.

434
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,840
I can't be last in the technical for a third week in a row.

435
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,800
After a morning filled with breakfast pastries,

436
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,120
the bakers now face an afternoon baking an ultimate tea-time classic.

437
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,120
OK, bakers, welcome to your pastry Technical Challenge.

438
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,600
Now, Mary has set this challenge for you today.

439
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
Any words of advice, Mary?

440
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,520
I want sheer perfection, so please keep your cool.

441
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,120
- Right, off you pop, my darlings. 
- See you back for judging.

442
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
The things I could tell you about them.

443
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,160
Right, Paul and Mary would very much like you to make a Bakewell tart.

444
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,320
And the clue is in the title.

445
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,360
You've got to bake WELL,

446
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,200
- not bake badly...
- No. 
- ..bake well a tart.

447
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,160
You've got two and a half hours on this Bakewell tart challenge.

448
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,200
- On your marks.
- Get set. 
- BOTH:
- Bake.

449
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,440
I've never made a Bakewell tart.

450
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,760
I kind of know what it should look like.

451
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,000
It was my nan's favourite thing to make, really.

452
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I have made Bakewell tarts before.

453
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,640
I quite like Bakewell tarts.

454
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,160
It is a Great British classic.

455
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,880
Some of them have struggled in technical challenges in the past,

456
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,200
but I think everybody should know what a Bakewell tart

457
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
should look like.

458
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,680
They really should and, I mean, they know about baking blind.

459
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,280
Most of them will have made frangipane in some form before,

460
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,200
they'll have done cakes with feather icing before,

461
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,520
it's putting all those skills together in one item.

462
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,040
Well, obviously, yours looks great.

463
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,880
So you've got a beautiful layer of icing, great frangipane...

464
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,280
- No soggy bottom. Let's have a look. 
- No soggy bottom there, Mary.

465
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,760
And a really thin layer of pastry.

466
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
It's beautiful, the almond flavour,

467
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
tartness coming from the jam,

468
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,400
- crispiness from the base underneath. 
- Hmm. Oh, so good.

469
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,120
- Well done, Bezza. 
- What was that about your diet?

470
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,400
Oh, yeah, there's not very many instructions here.

471
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
First step is - "Make a jam."

472
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,120
I'm just softening the raspberries first.

473
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Second instruction - "Make a sweet shortcrust pastry."

474
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,560
I think there are people in the room who know how to make

475
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,240
a Bakewell tart, who have made it before.

476
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,240
I think the winners would be the...aged.

477
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm sure someone like Val has made a Bakewell tart before.

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Looking over, she seems quite determined.

479
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,440
That's the pastry made.

480
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,640
It's just going into the fridge for half an hour now.

481
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,720
The instructions say, "Make a frangipane."

482
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,720
- MUTTERS:
- How do you make a frangipane?

483
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,320
I've never made a frangipane before.

484
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,680
I'm just doing it in the order that it is in the recipe.

485
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,520
It's a bit creative, I'm going to just kind of go with my gut.

486
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,440
But one baker has been going with their gut since the technical

487
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,240
challenge started.

488
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,760
SHE GASPS

489
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,600
I only thought there was one sheet and I've baked for the

490
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,320
first 15, 20 minutes with that sheet.

491
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,120
- Gosh.
- Everything I've done, I've guessed.

492
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,920
So, rhetorical question - have you ever made a Bakewell tart before?

493
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,440
Yes. I make a different one and I make it every week.

494
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
- You make a Bakewell tart every week? 
- Yeah.

495
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,120
It feels really old-school, yeah. It's, like, retro kind of baking.

496
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,680
- It's just classic and classy... 
- Yeah.
- ..not old.

497
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Classic and classy.

498
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
- Classic and classy.
- There we go.

499
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,960
- You're only allowed one teaspoon of almond.
- Ta-da!

500
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,080
- I'd have put two in. 
- Of course you would, Val.

501
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,800
- What's a recipe for if not to just totally ignore?
- Yeah.

502
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,240
Good pastry, I think.

503
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,280
What do they say? "Line the tin with pastry."

504
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,400
I think Bakewell tarts have a thin pastry.

505
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
We're looking for about pound coin sickness.

506
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,560
I made it a bit thicker because I wanted to be able to get it

507
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
out of the flan dish.

508
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,360
Don't want a soggy bottom, so I'm just trying to make sure there are

509
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,760
no gaps, there are no holes.

510
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,560
I think, when Mary said she was looking for perfection,

511
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,400
the pastry case is going to be the thing that you see around the side.

512
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,120
She said, "Keep it cool,"

513
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,400
so, I'm going to, literally, get this back in the fridge.

514
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm going to chill it down again.

515
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,880
"Make an icing, colour a small amount of icing pink, ice the top,

516
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,080
"decorate with traditional feather design."

517
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,440
I don't think Mary wants the pink icing neon.

518
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,560
- Is that pink or red? 
- BENJAMINA LAUGHS

519
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,560
So, next it says - "Bake."

520
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,440
So, I'm going to blind bake it.

521
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
I wouldn't normally bake it blind.

522
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm just going to bake it a short while blind - five minutes.

523
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,160
90 minutes remaining.

524
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,840
It's not cooked yet, but I want to just take that off now.

525
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,160
This may be a bit on the thick side and a bit on the chewy side.

526
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,320
Coming out.

527
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm happy with it, it's got a nice colour to it.

528
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,840
Edges have come away a little bit.

529
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,080
Well, that's not ideal.

530
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,720
I perhaps didn't pierce it quite enough.

531
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,120
"Fill the pastry case."

532
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,680
It doesn't say what with.

533
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,360
I know it's raspberry jam on the bottom and then the frangipane

534
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,560
on top, and then the icing.

535
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

536
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,880
Quite nostalgic for me, this.

537
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,120
Have I not shown you my picture? Me and my nanny.

538
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,840
- Oh, you've got your nan's glasses on.
- Yeah.

539
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,800
- What about her Bakewell?
- It was a really, really good Bakewell.

540
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,240
It was weird cos mum texted me this morning saying,

541
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
"Your nan would be really proud."

542
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,080
- I feel...
- Ohh.
- Yeah, so...
- Ohh.

543
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,720
- We'll channel the nan.
- I am. 
- Channel the spirit of the nan.

544
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,120
Go on, Margaret.

545
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,400
Bakers, I don't want to put you in a frangi-panic,

546
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
but you've only got an hour left.

547
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,920
I don't think I've rushed it.

548
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm now going to pipe on my frangipane mix.

549
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm not going to hit you, honestly.

550
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,280
It doesn't matter. At this stage, it would almost come as a blessing.

551
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,120
I knew there was going to be an issue.

552
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,840
See, what I didn't want was for the jam to mix with the frangipane

553
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,880
and that's exactly what's happened here.

554
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,680
OK, it's time to bake.

555
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,400
I'm going to start off with about 15 minutes.

556
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm glad I got it in early - it's taking ages to cook.

557
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,840
RAV SIGHS

558
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,120
It's not looking very baked, but I'm not actually sure what the

559
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,640
top of it's meant to look like when it's baked.

560
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
Not enough time.

561
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,040
It's not cooking as...

562
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,280
Oh, my word, the oven wasn't on.

563
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,440
- Ohh.
- What happened? 
- The oven's not on.

564
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,560
- CANDICE:
- What have you done? 
- My oven's off.
- No.

565
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,520
- What?! 
- RAV:
- Oh, no.

566
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,960
That's unfortunate. I've been sat here for 15 minutes doing nothing.

567
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,040
Just 20 minutes remaining.

568
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,160
It's rising.

569
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,880
I like it gooey. It's just about cooked,

570
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
so I'm going to start fanning it.

571
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,160
Is mine the only one out?

572
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,400
I think she knows exactly what she's doing.

573
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll be surprised if she doesn't come first.

574
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,840
It's coming out. It needs to cool down.

575
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,600
I don't have time.

576
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,840
- There we go.
- I'm kind of assuming it'll now firm up.

577
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,440
We're going to go with that.

578
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,800
Hm...

579
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,280
A quick waft. It's never going to be cool!

580
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,480
We only need it to be cool enough to get the icing on.

581
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,880
We don't need it to be fully cooled down yet.

582
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,160
Just going to have to go for it, I'm afraid.

583
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Benjamina, my love, time very much of the essence now.

584
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,480
Oh, come on.

585
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,200
Ooh, there she blows.

586
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,240
My hands are shaking.

587
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
- Jane, cover your ears.
- Why?

588
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,520
OK, bakers, that's five minutes!

589
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,960
- It's not working. 
- Far too hot to be putting it on.

590
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Gosh! It's all falling apart!

591
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,360
Bakewell tart is still hot. It's setting the icing.

592
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Right, it's coming out.

593
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,520
It's definitely melting.

594
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
It's going to have to go on hot.

595
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,720
It's kind of collapsing.

596
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Urgh!

597
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,080
What a state!

598
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,840
Stop. Just stop, Tom.

599
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,480
This is a disaster.

600
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,800
This couldn't have gone much more wrong.

601
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,640
OK, bakers. Time's up.

602
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
Oh, my God!

603
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,680
I'm missing a whole side!

604
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,320
Time to bring your Bakewells up to the chequered altar, please.

605
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
It's awful!

606
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,240
Pop them behind the photo of yourselves.

607
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,720
You know the drill.

608
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,320
'Paul and Mary are looking for a crispy pastry case,

609
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,360
'clearly defined layers of jam, frangipane, and feathered icing.'

610
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,000
- Right, shall we start with this one then, Mary?
- Mm.

611
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
Ooh, it cuts well. It's a nice crispy bottom.

612
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
There's a layer of jam.

613
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
There is a layer of frangipane, which has risen up at the side.

614
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,560
It's a good flavour, too.

615
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,480
Moving on, there is feathering on the top.

616
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,080
- Good colour on the pastry. 
- Base is done OK.

617
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,920
And also, the pastry is the same thickness

618
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,120
on the bottom and up the sides.

619
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,360
It's neat enough, but the frangipane isn't quite done

620
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
and too much jam for me.

621
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,840
We've got a good colour in the pastry here.

622
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,600
The feathering is very, very close together,

623
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,440
so you don't get quite the effect

624
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,000
when you pull the cocktail stick through.

625
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Pastry's good underneath. Nice and strong, Mary.

626
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,160
- Good flavour.
- Tastes OK.

627
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,280
But the icing was put on while it was still warm.

628
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,080
Right, let's move on to number four.

629
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Oh, dear. It's still on the base as well. Collapsed.

630
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,080
This is just goo.

631
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,080
- There's a little bit too much jam, but it's a beautiful jam.
- Mm.

632
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,800
Moving on, it is baked, it is whole, looks quite thick.

633
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,800
A layer of jam, frangipane. You've got all the elements there.

634
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,920
It's still very warm, isn't it?

635
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,000
And of course, if you put that on warm,

636
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,880
you've had to put quite a lot of icing on there

637
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,000
in order to cover the whole thing.

638
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,120
This one hasn't got finished on the icing.

639
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,440
Probably cos they thought,

640
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,240
"I'm not putting it on cos it's too hot."

641
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,840
If I cut there, you look at that and go,

642
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,320
"Actually, that's not too bad." Nicely baked underneath.

643
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah. Taste is very good,

644
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,960
but we haven't got any icing on the top.

645
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
It's not on the top.

646
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,880
Right, moving on to this one. At least the icing's nice and level.

647
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,440
No feathering.

648
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,800
But we have a very good example of lovely, thin pastry,

649
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,040
beautifully baked.

650
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,840
Moving on to the last one -

651
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,560
I reckon you could stand on that, Mary, and it wouldn't break.

652
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,240
- It's holding its own, as you would say.
- It is.

653
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,640
Right. There's your soggy bottom, Mary.

654
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,680
We had to wait a while for it.

655
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
The last one, yeah. And that pastry is raw.

656
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,120
Mary and Paul will now rate the Bakewell tarts

657
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,440
from the worst to the best.

658
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,640
In eighth place is this one.

659
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,120
That's me again.

660
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,360
Tasted OK, but looking like that, you just can't present it.

661
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,880
In seventh place, whose is this?

662
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,040
Your frangipane is running off the plate

663
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,720
and the pastry is rather thick.

664
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,680
MEL: In sixth place is Andrew,

665
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
fifth, Benjamina,

666
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,120
and fourth place, Tom.

667
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,760
And in third place...

668
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,960
We had a good pastry here. It was holding together.

669
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,680
In second place is this one.

670
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,240
Whose is this?

671
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,280
- The pastry's OK. Watch the jam and the layers.
- Yeah.

672
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,720
But there is distinctive feathering in there and it is fairly level.

673
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,360
- And in first place... 
- THEY APPLAUD

674
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,520
Beautiful crust, good feathering,

675
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,320
the right proportion frangipane to raspberry jam

676
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
and when we cut it, it held together.

677
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,120
- Well done.
- Thank you.

678
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,480
'I would love to have made a Bakewell tart as good as my nan.

679
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,840
'She's probably having'

680
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,800
a little bit of a laugh, going, "What are you doing, Candice?!"

681
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,080
First place - that extra experience carries you through

682
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,680
with some of these things.

683
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,000
I don't feel very good about it. I took mine out a bit too soon.

684
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,200
Really got to work hard tomorrow

685
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,920
and hope that will compensate for a soggy bottom.

686
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Last for the third week in a row.

687
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,200
It's not a good place to be, really.

688
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,240
A miracle has to happen tomorrow for me to get through!

689
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,200
Tomorrow, I'll be checking my oven.

690
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,040
Pastry week seems to have divided the pack yet again.

691
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,720
It's the girls at the top. Jane has been right up there.

692
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
Candice, she's done well.

693
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,520
I think those two have pulled away and are in line for Star Baker.

694
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,760
I think the people in trouble are Benjamina...

695
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,720
Who, of course, was Star Baker last week

696
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,280
and has had a bit of a nightmare.

697
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
I think she got flustered and she got behind.

698
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,640
I worry about, I think, Val.

699
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,840
Tom in the Signature, it wasn't good at all.

700
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,680
We know that Rav's capable of delivering really good flavours.

701
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,320
Pastry has not, so far, been his forte.

702
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,280
I think Rav is really in trouble.

703
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,120
I think he's struggled for the last couple of weeks now.

704
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,120
Morning, bakers. Hearty welcome to Showstopper day.

705
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,640
Paul and Mary would very much like you to make

706
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,480
48 filo pastry amuse-bouches.

707
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,040
One savour batch, please. One sweet batch. 24 in each.

708
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,040
- But the fillings must be delicious. 
- Of course!

709
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,600
Who'd make an un-delicious filling on a Bake Off?!

710
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,320
- Exactly! 
- You've got four hours.

711
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,640
- On your marks...
- Get set... Bake!
- Bake!

712
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,280
Filo pastry is notoriously difficult to make.

713
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,080
I've made it a couple of times in the past

714
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,960
and it hasn't always turned out right.

715
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,560
First time I made filo pastry was about 35 years ago.

716
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,600
And I thought, "This is no joke!" And I never made it again!

717
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,400
Filo pastry is difficult, but it's not impossible.

718
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,080
It's about stretching that dough.

719
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,040
The trick is to get it wafer, wafer-thin,

720
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,400
so that when you hold it up, you can almost see through it.

721
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,840
Now, that's just the filo.

722
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,600
This isn't a main course - this is amuse-bouche.

723
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,120
We've got to be bite-size and I know I've got a big mouth,

724
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,680
but I'm talking inch and a half max.

725
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,640
It's actually quite a basic dough recipe.

726
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,480
But it's all in the way that you work it

727
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,600
and the amount of time that you allow it to rest.

728
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,800
Rav's planning to find a whole hour

729
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,320
to rest the dough for his Chinese prawn tartlets

730
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,640
and his spiced white chocolate samosas.

731
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,480
I still think I am going home.

732
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,160
It would be nice if I can somehow survive.

733
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,960
- Good morning, Val. 
- Good morning, Paul.

734
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,240
Tell us all about your filo amuse-bouches.

735
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,040
I'm going into the Christmas season a bit early.

736
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Val's making goat's cheese and caramelised onion tartlets,

737
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,480
which will be delivered

738
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,920
along with Santa's sacks filled with boozy mincemeat.

739
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,000
How are you going to be doing this? As a cup? As a parcel?

740
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,440
The savoury is going to be as a cup.

741
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,160
It will be two mouthfuls. I'm hoping that will be OK.

742
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,600
When you say two mouthfuls, Val, what size are we talking?

743
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,120
- Not Yorkshire gobfuls.
- OK.

744
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,120
Jane's also aiming for something a little more refined than a gobful.

745
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,640
I'm wrapping filo around these.

746
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,440
They've got to be neat, so they mustn't unravel

747
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,480
and they mustn't look raggedy round the top and the bottom.

748
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,120
Jane's making Roquefort, walnut and fig parcels

749
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,320
and morello cherry and chocolate truffle-filled filo cones.

750
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
Her dough will need to be the perfect consistency

751
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,320
to wrap around her moulds.

752
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,240
If it's too sloppy, it shrinks and then it looks horrible.

753
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,320
It's all about getting the texture of this right

754
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,240
to get the finish of these right.

755
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,320
Whilst Jane and most of the other bakers

756
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,200
are hoping to keep their dough firm...

757
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,840
It feels amazing.

758
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,440
..Tom and Andrew prefer things a little...wetter.

759
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,720
My filo is quite a slack mix, I find it easier to stretch.

760
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,520
It comes with its downfalls, but I prefer it.

761
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,560
Andrew's slack dough will encase spicy squash and chorizo

762
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,880
and will also be the foundation of his take on a classic baklava.

763
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,880
When it cools, it does firm up.

764
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,520
It's not quite this liquidy when it comes to stretching it.

765
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Baklava is the very reason that the tricky filo pastry exists...

766
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,960
..and perfecting it is a 700-year-old royal calling.

767
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,640
It's was in the 13th century in the Ottoman sultan's kitchens

768
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,120
that the royal chefs developed filo

769
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,080
and in this bakery in north London,

770
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,280
they're still making it the very same way.

771
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,360
This is amazing.

772
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,400
It's like a sort of hospital, in a good way.

773
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,720
How are you doing, Ahmet?

774
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,160
- Very good.
- Nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you too.
- I'm Mel.

775
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,440
- Listen, can I get stuck in?
- Sure.

776
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Following a traditional recipe called yufka,

777
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,920
which in Turkish means "fragile",

778
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,320
multiple sheets of pastry are wrapped onto a long rolling pin

779
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,840
and stretched out before being separated, floured and rolled again.

780
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,840
- It's like muslin, isn't it? 
- It is not ready yet.
- Really?

781
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,200
- When it is ready, I can see through. 
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

782
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,000
- How do I start?
- Just try.

783
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
SHE CHORTLES

784
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,200
You're getting there, don't worry.

785
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,960
Well done.

786
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
It's gone wrinkly.

787
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,560
- That's OK.
- No, it's not good.

788
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,080
The process of creating filo was such a skill

789
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,920
that the number of sheets became a sign of wealth,

790
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,840
with grand households demanding a minimum of 100 layers.

791
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,000
Looking for exciting ways to serve the pastry,

792
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,520
baklava was created by the sultan's kitchen,

793
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,000
sandwiching pistachio between the filo

794
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,880
before sprinkling it with butter.

795
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,200
The baklava is sliced and baked.

796
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,200
This process now, you're putting this amazing syrup on the top...

797
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,120
- Yeah.
- ..to create the baklava disco

798
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,360
and is that just sugar and water in there?

799
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,080
- Yes.
- How much sugar do you actually get through a month?
- Two tonnes.

800
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,680
That's a lot of sugar, Ahmet.

801
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,120
As the Ottoman Empire grew,

802
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,520
the sultan captured slaves to become part of his army.

803
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,640
Every Ramadan,

804
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,920
the royal kitchen prepared hundreds of trays of baklava

805
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,880
carried on poles with knotted clothes

806
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,320
in what was known as the Baklava Procession.

807
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,440
This sweet delicacy was a gift for their service

808
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,320
and by accepting this tribute, they pledged loyalty to the sultan

809
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
and to their taste buds.

810
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,680
The Ottoman Empire crumbled in 1922.

811
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,760
Luckily, the baklava didn't and can still be found

812
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,560
wherever the sultan's influence had spread.

813
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,920
Talking of which, this is quite a spread, guys.

814
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,440
I ordered ten trays?

815
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,520
Lovely, thanks. One, two, three, four.

816
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,640
Yeah, just put the others down there. That's great.

817
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Having chosen to make a wet filo dough...

818
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,080
It's going to rest for at least half an hour.

819
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,160
..Tom is also taking a gamble with his fillings.

820
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,800
My flavours are risky, especially the savoury one,

821
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,640
but I always want to just push it.

822
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,920
In his filo cups, Tom will combine strips of sirloin steak

823
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,360
with a spicy chocolate mousse

824
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,920
and wine-poached pears with ginger.

825
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,200
- That's meat? 
- That's meat in cocoa powder

826
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
with a little bit of chilli powder.

827
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,480
I thought those were very flat brownies.

828
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,600
When it comes out, what are you going to do with it?

829
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,240
It'll be very thinly sliced,

830
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,360
so you should get the nice char on the outside

831
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,080
and the beautiful pink middle.

832
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,080
- Yeah.
- You've really thought this all through.
- Yeah.

833
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,840
Just giving it a good squeeze together to make sure I can kind of

834
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,480
see the distribution and see if I need a bit more sausage.

835
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,400
It's good to get your hands in and give your sausages a good squeeze.

836
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,160
Candice is aiming for a taste of Scotland

837
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,360
with her sausage and black pudding apples,

838
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,960
paired with banoffee and whisky cups.

839
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,680
How have you got on with your filo pastries?

840
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm actually using a pasta machine to roll it through.

841
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
A girl after my own heart, you see. Not too much work.

842
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,440
Have you got enough black pudding?

843
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,240
You know what, I'm not sure, actually. What do you think?

844
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,960
Feel the weight of that, Mary.

845
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,600
You're only making 24, you know.

846
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,440
This is my plantain, so it will be quite sweet

847
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,400
and that will balance out with the chilli and the saltiness.

848
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,680
Benjamina's fried plantain will be blended with spinach

849
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,120
for her filo samosas to go with her pear cups with creme patissiere

850
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,400
flavoured with chai tea.

851
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
- Where does the influence come from? 
- I'm Nigerian.

852
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,080
- We eat this with everything. 
- Do you?

853
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,360
I thought, make it a bit more sophisticated,

854
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,440
an amuse-bouche, so, yeah.

855
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,200
- SHE LAUGHS 
- My mum will be happy to see it.

856
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,400
I'm making my coffee creme pat, so it's got egg yolks, sugar,

857
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,200
milk, vanilla...

858
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,480
..coffee.

859
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,280
Selasi's coffee cream cups will be topped with a single praline

860
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
and his savoury will have individual spears of asparagus

861
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,480
wrapped in Parma ham and filo.

862
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,160
Simplicity is good.

863
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,080
Simplicity is very good.

864
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,800
But once the fillings have been prepared...

865
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,600
I know this is saying it a bit too early,

866
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
but I might actually have some time to spare.

867
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,400
..this Showstopper gets rather complicated.

868
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,600
To deliver the filo's classic crispiness...

869
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,920
..from the middle.

870
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,880
..the bakers will have to stretch their delicate rested dough

871
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,320
as thinly as possible.

872
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,160
That's got some little lumps of flour in it,

873
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,640
which is a bit annoying.

874
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,600
And they can use any technique they like.

875
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,280
My method of stretching is to just put it over my knuckles.

876
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,360
Probably change halfway through.

877
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,400
I'm going to roll it out as thin as I can using the rolling pin

878
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,760
and when I can't roll it out any more with the rolling pin,

879
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,600
I'll start stretching it with my hands.

880
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,280
Like a pizza.

881
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,240
The thing is, it tears quite easily.

882
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,040
This is an idea I got off of the internet.

883
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,000
It's just a piece of broom handle.

884
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,040
Clean, brand-new.

885
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,600
If you pull it and stretch it

886
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,880
and then stretch it onto the rolling pin,

887
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,960
it helps to stretch it, apparently.

888
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,760
I'll try anything to get this stuff thin.

889
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
That's not thin enough.

890
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,320
It was hurting my shoulder to roll out so much,

891
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,000
so I thought I'd give it a go

892
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,080
and I was actually really pleased with how it turned out.

893
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,120
It is almost the right thickness.

894
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,400
Let's see if you can read a bottle of alcohol through it.

895
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,480
- Yeah, you can almost, can't you? 
- It is time-consuming.

896
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,280
- MEL:
- But once the bakers think their filo is thin enough...

897
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,600
Nice and thin.

898
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,400
..the Showstopper gets even harder to handle.

899
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,000
It's awful.

900
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,680
It's fiddly and foldy.

901
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,280
The bakers need to create

902
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,280
tiny, bite-sized, identical amuse-bouches...

903
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,200
That still seems a bit wide.

904
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,000
..with the most delicate pastry there is...

905
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,600
It is being uncooperative at the moment.

906
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,120
..48 times.

907
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,320
I am putting butter in-between each layer

908
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,040
so that the layers crisp up and stay separate.

909
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,320
I've never heard the tent this quiet.

910
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,040
Everyone's just on it,

911
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,760
cos we know time has not been our friend in this tent.

912
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,920
45 minutes remaining.

913
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,720
- I'm very jealous of that pastry. 
- Why's that?

914
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,960
- It's a lot better than my pastry. That's beautiful.
- Thanks.

915
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,520
My savoury - rolling them into sort of ball shapes.

916
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,600
There is a bit of a danger,

917
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,280
filling it with a slightly wet filling,

918
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,480
that it can come through.

919
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
As you can see on some of the earlier ones,

920
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,440
they've fallen victim to that, but I'm going to bake them anyway.

921
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,240
A wing and a prayer.

922
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,240
Or not, as the case may be.

923
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,880
For six minutes, they are there, then I will check it.

924
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,600
Sorry!

925
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,680
Oh! Argh!

926
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,800
OK, bakers, you've got half an hour left on this.

927
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,240
They look done.

928
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,600
Got a nice colour to them.

929
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,520
I think they're done. Nice.

930
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,600
That was meant to happen.

931
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm looking for it to be medium rare/rare.

932
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,000
- Val, how's it going, my lovely?
- Awful!

933
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,800
- No, why?
- Yes! Because look at that disaster.

934
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,240
- Ooh.
- It's so fine. I didn't put enough cornflour between it.

935
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,680
Have you seen any John Carpenter films?

936
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,760
Damn!

937
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,240
Right, I'm just going to take these out now.

938
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,040
I left my cherry jam in there to cool and I've actually frozen it.

939
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,680
I was so calm earlier.

940
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,280
Bakers, five minutes left on your mighty bouches.

941
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,640
- Five minutes left. 
- I'm going to put these in.

942
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,080
These are better baked than not baked. In.

943
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,240
It's gone medium rare.

944
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,120
This is a medium rare, but that'll be fine.

945
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,080
No-one's going to spit that out, put it that way.

946
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,000
They're looking really nice. I'm quite pleased with them.

947
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,720
This is the final push. I've got my final samosas in the oven.

948
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,120
Look, it's just going like that.

949
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,640
This is messy.

950
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Better get these on a board.

951
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,000
There, I'm actually done.

952
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,880
Still got a few minutes to spare.

953
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,480
- Do you need a hand, Jane?
- Could you? Thank you so much, Selasi.

954
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,560
Nope, not ready.

955
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,840
OK, bakers, that's it, time's up.

956
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,320
- Candice, stop fiddling. 
- Leave your balls alone.

957
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,440
- There you go.
- It felt crisp.

958
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,560
I left it in there a lot longer than I would have.

959
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,680
Oh, what a mess.

960
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,320
Wow, I'm going home.

961
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,560
Oh, well.

962
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,680
It's judgment time for the filo amuse-bouches.

963
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,320
They're the right size. They look appetising.

964
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,920
Let's try one of these, then.

965
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,200
The plantain, such a nice flavour inside.

966
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,720
It tastes delicious.

967
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,080
- That little bit of heat in there as well.
- Bit of chilli.

968
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,560
It's just enough.

969
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,440
That's good. Lovely combination.

970
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,120
The flavours of the chai come through beautifully with the pear.

971
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,360
- Nice and crispy on the shell. I like them.
- Thank you.

972
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,280
- MEL:
- Are you all right there? 
- Yeah.

973
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,680
Whoo-whoo!

974
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,200
It's got the asparagus and the meat and that's pretty much it, really.

975
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,560
It's quite dry.

976
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,720
All those flavours - a beautiful marriage.

977
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,960
The cases should have a bit more butter,

978
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,680
just to make it that gorgeous golden-brown colour.

979
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,440
Because they're so tiny,

980
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,800
you've got to get some very piquant flavour in there

981
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,440
and you've got it.

982
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,080
Move on to these.

983
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,280
A deconstructed baklava is what you have there. It tastes beautiful.

984
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,600
Oh, thank you.

985
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,400
It just looks a bit, in Mary's words...

986
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,640
ALL: "Informal."

987
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,120
It's gone on a night out, I think.

988
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,480
Yeah.

989
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,240
Secondly, they're too big.

990
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,440
A 50p piece is what you need to be looking at.

991
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
The meat is a lovely flavour.

992
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,400
I don't know that I recognise it's chocolate, but it's good.

993
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,280
For me, it doesn't go. It's too bitter.

994
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,560
This is the sweet one.

995
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,440
Even though it's so pale, it's beautifully crisp.

996
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,520
You can feel the pears, the texture,

997
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,080
but the ginger just overwhelms everything.

998
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,480
A little bit disappointed, if I'm honest.

999
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
These look fantastic.

1000
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,400
You were very brave to do something totally different with filo pastry.

1001
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
However, that's not an amuse-bouche.

1002
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,200
- It's too big.
- Oh, OK.

1003
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,680
I do like the look of these. The size is good, they feel crispy.

1004
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,360
It's absolutely delicious.

1005
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,440
The overwhelming flavour is the Roquefort,

1006
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,680
which is not a bad thing.

1007
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,520
You do get the cured meat in there as well.

1008
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,440
Right, choose your weapon, Mary.

1009
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,760
- They taste amazing.
- OK. 
- I don't need to eat that.

1010
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,480
All the flavour was in my mouthful, that's it. That is wasted.

1011
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,080
I'm getting the chocolate,

1012
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,880
I'm getting the cream, getting the cherry.

1013
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,320
It's all in that one mouthful.

1014
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,880
It's absolutely beautiful, but just too much of it.

1015
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,120
Oh, OK, thank you.

1016
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,720
Sadly, there are only 12 mincemeat parcels.

1017
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,560
The rest were still in the oven.

1018
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,400
Time management was probably an issue.

1019
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,160
Overall, they're too big.

1020
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,560
No.

1021
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,720
They're underdone.

1022
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,640
The onion has seeped into the pastry and not cooked.

1023
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
OK, let's have a look at the sweet one.

1024
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,960
It's very thick. Straight away, you can feel that.

1025
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,040
- Wow, OK.
- I know.

1026
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,680
This really does look more like shortcrust pastry

1027
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,320
than filo, I'm afraid.

1028
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,920
- Filling's good. 
- The only decent thing to eat on it.

1029
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,120
I think I agree.

1030
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,560
Excellent filling, but the pastry's too thick.

1031
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,160
First of all, I think they look fantastic.

1032
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,440
They're all the same size,

1033
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,000
the way it's been displayed, ten out of ten.

1034
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,520
- Thank you very much. 
- Let's get tasting.

1035
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,200
Sausage meat, black pudding and apple.

1036
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,640
You've managed to carry through flavours in there

1037
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,560
and in the shape that you were trying to create

1038
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,080
and get it crispy as well is extremely difficult.

1039
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,000
That's spot-on, that. That's really nice.

1040
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,440
Thank you very much.

1041
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,760
Right, banoffee.

1042
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,960
That's scrumptious. It really is lovely.

1043
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,040
Again, thank you very much.

1044
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,840
- That is delicious.
- Thank you.

1045
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,480
(Star Baker!)

1046
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,080
(Well done!)

1047
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,440
(Brilliant!)

1048
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,840
They look beautifully proportioned, good colour.

1049
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,360
All they've got to do now is taste good.

1050
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,040
I hope they taste good, mate, cos they do look good.

1051
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,680
- This is the prawn Chinese-style, isn't it?
- Yes.

1052
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,360
Straight in.

1053
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,600
That's just the sort of surprise I like before a meal.

1054
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,920
They taste beautiful.

1055
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,840
For my sweet, I've got spiced white chocolate and hazelnut samosas.

1056
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,920
Those, too, beautifully proportioned,

1057
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,120
good flavour, lovely.

1058
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,000
- Thanks.
- Well done, Rav.
- Thanks.

1059
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,440
We started with Jane and Candice ahead of the pack. Still the case?

1060
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,440
Candice, those banoffees, they were to die for

1061
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,400
and, of course, Jane's done very well.

1062
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,000
Her flavours were so good.

1063
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,920
Rav came into the last challenge in a bit of trouble,

1064
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,800
but these are beautiful.

1065
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,440
Has he done enough? He was way down, wasn't he?

1066
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,560
To be honest, I think both Benjamina and Rav have both done enough.

1067
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,680
The two people left are Val and Tom.

1068
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,800
Val's were far too big.

1069
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,840
But the worst thing is we only had half of what we asked for

1070
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,240
and they're raw.

1071
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,960
Tom, there's no shape to them, but the flavour's just way off base.

1072
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,680
Are you thinking along the same lines?

1073
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,160
- We're agreeing totally.
- Are you? 
- Mm-hm.
- That's a first.

1074
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,960
And I'm going to race you to one of Benjamina's triangles.

1075
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,400
- I thought you were taking those home.
- Not any more.

1076
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,880
Bakers, what a weekend.

1077
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,200
I get the great job - I get to announce Star Baker.

1078
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,120
Star Baker this week took the high road

1079
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,880
while others perhaps took the lower road.

1080
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,160
Goodness, gracious, great balls of pig -

1081
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,960
- Candice, you're our Star Baker. MEL:
- Whoo!

1082
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,760
APPLAUSE

1083
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,200
Now, my job gets harder every week,

1084
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,240
but as you know, we can't take everyone into next week,

1085
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,040
so the person not coming with us is...

1086
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,480
..Val.

1087
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,080
Come on, Val.

1088
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,640
I've reached my limit.

1089
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,960
I love Val, her character was fantastic in the tent.

1090
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,360
She really buoyed everybody up every week.

1091
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,160
'A great baker, without a shadow of a doubt,

1092
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,960
'but this was not her week.'

1093
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,720
Who are you going to have to torment you now?

1094
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,320
- LAUGHING:
- You did well, though.

1095
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,880
When I chatted to her afterwards, she said,

1096
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,920
"I've so enjoyed being here, but that's as far as I can go."

1097
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,840
When you bake, you always bake for a reason

1098
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,560
and you're giving it to people,

1099
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,160
so you make it the best you can and you make it with love.

1100
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,480
Whenever I make anything, I stir love into it,

1101
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,520
I knead love into it,

1102
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,960
so when I present it, it's special.

1103
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,520
I'm not unhappy. I've had a great time with some great people.

1104
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,480
And - phew! - I didn't expect it.

1105
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,080
I didn't expect to ever get here,

1106
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,080
never mind be on it.

1107
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,840
Val was just a really positive presence in the tent.

1108
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,680
She'd come up with little games for us to play in-between bakes.

1109
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,680
Today, she was reading a 1977 shopping receipt

1110
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,600
and having us guess the prices.

1111
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,040
I think if Val had got all 48 out, I think it'd be me going.

1112
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,840
Got a little bit of survivor syndrome, I think, this week.

1113
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,680
I'm like the comeback kid, it seems.

1114
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,040
Whenever something goes wrong,

1115
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,320
there's always something that goes right.

1116
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,440
I wasn't surprised that Candice won Star Baker.

1117
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,040
I'd have put my life savings on it.

1118
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,320
I haven't got any.

1119
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,040
Ah! Well done!

1120
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,880
I thought it was Jane's, I really did.

1121
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,440
That's amazing. It means a lot, it really, really does.

1122
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,120
- Next time... 
- Grr!

1123
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,960
..the bakers get green-fingered...

1124
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,840
I wish I'd chosen fresh flowers now.

1125
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,960
..in the first-ever botanical week.

1126
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,120
- Tastes like elderflowers. 
- I just can't tell any more.

1127
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,760
But will their meringue pies...

1128
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,880
Good, makes you go...

1129
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,200
..leave a bitter taste?

1130
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,160
That's a little bit too soft.

1131
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,200
Will anyone bake a technically perfect herby bread?

1132
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,360
That is not cooked.

1133
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,840
- And who will blossom... 
- I've got no chance.

1134
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,680
..in the floral cake Showstopper...

1135
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,600
- It's beautiful. 
- Absolutely cracked it.

1136
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,360
- ..in the closest... 
- It's not cooked, man.

1137
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,800
..Bake Off yet?

1138
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,680
I've never been so stressed about dough in my life.
