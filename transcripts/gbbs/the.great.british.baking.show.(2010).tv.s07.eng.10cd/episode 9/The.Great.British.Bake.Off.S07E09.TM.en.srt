1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,120
- Semi.
- Finals. - Drama. - Jeopardy. - Excitement! - Tension. - Bakers!

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,560
- Passion!
- Are. - We. - Going. - To. - Do.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,400
- This.
- Whole. - Link. - Like. - This?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
- Yes.
- Good.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
- Welcome.
- To. - The. - Great. - British. - Bake. - Off.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
Last time...

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,320
- Oh, what?
- ..Bake Off turned back the clock to Tudor Week.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,240
Looks really healthy, doesn't
it? Lovely lot of fat.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,840
- There was even a spot of jousting.
- The...um...

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,360
Ahem...jousting pole...

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,560
Really that should have
gone on the hand(!)

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
After getting lost in a marzipan maze...

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
The cake feels quite doughy.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
..it was Benjamina who became the
eighth baker to leave the tent...

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,760
It's so much fun being in there,

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,960
and it's so much fun
baking with everyone.

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,280
..and Candice was awarded
Star Baker for the third time.

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Now, it's the semifinal and
only four bakers remain.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,240
We can do this, guys.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,640
We can really do this.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,240
We're so close, and to
go home today would be

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,360
really, really disappointing.

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,960
You're nervous that any
small thing that goes wrong

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,680
could be your last day in the tent.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,960
It's scary, yeah - it's the last
one that someone goes home...

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
Because the next time,
someone will be the winner.

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,160
I had a dream I made it to the
final and I baked in a dress.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,440
So, if I make it to the final this week,

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,800
then it looks like I'm going to
have to be baking in a dress!

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Just three patisserie challenges...

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,240
- Bake, bake, bake!
- It's just not cooking!

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
'..stand between THEM...' Selasi,
are you scared for the first time?

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,600
- Yeah...
- '..and a place in the final.'

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
- The more we say it to ourselves, Jane...
- It will be...

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,840
BOTH: ..absolutely fine.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,760
The Signature Bake awaits.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,080
Good luck, everybody.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,040
(Good luck!)

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,720
Bonjour, boulangers et boulangeres.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,120
Welcome to your semifinal.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Huge congratulations
for getting this far,

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,240
but listen up - to get
a place in the final,

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,080
today you're going to have
to embrace your French side.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,200
Paul and Mary would love you to make

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,280
24 savoury Palmiers.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
So, we'd like you to make two
different styles and flavours,

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
so that's 12 of each,

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
and we'd like FULL puff pastry.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
None of your rough-puff

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,480
or your "ever so tough-puff" or
"I've made it in the buff-puff".

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Now, bakers, you've got
three hours - trois heures -

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,080
- on your marks...
- Get set and... BOTH: - Bake!

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,160
Semifinal.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,760
It's just so empty in here.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,680
I don't think I've been quite
as nervous as this, actually.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
I feel a bit queasy!

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,160
I've never made Palmiers before,

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,680
but it should be all right.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,920
A perfect Palmier, you should
be able to see the layers of the

60
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,040
puff pastry all the way through.

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,400
Palmier tends to be quite flat.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,080
If it's too thick, then it becomes
something else. It becomes a pastry.

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,040
The skill is how they
incorporate the flavour.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,240
No good putting great
bulky things in the pastry,

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,640
it'll ruin the layers.

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,960
Whatever flavours you're
going to add, add little,

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,400
but it's got to pack a punch.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,440
The final is just down the road now,

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,640
this is the time you've got to smash it.

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
I do enjoy making pastry.
It's just sometimes

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,760
things in the tent go
differently to how you expect.

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,600
The key to Palmiers is a
successful puff pastry, which first

73
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,800
requires the bakers to create
pliable dough from flour and water.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,200
I've used a mix of strong
flour and ordinary plain flour.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,920
The strong plain flour,

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,480
you've got more gluten in, so
it gives you more flexibility.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,560
Paul I think uses all strong plain
flour, I think, in his recipe.

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,200
So I've kind of...hedged my bets
and gone somewhere down the middle.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
I've just used plain flour, yeah?

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm just doing what I do at home!

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm just trying to work this
to a nice smooth consistency,

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,160
before bashing out my butter,

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,960
which will then hopefully
create the layers.

84
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,480
- Morning, Candice.
- Good morning! - Hello!

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,760
- So, are you using strong flour?
- I'm using half strong, half plain flour.

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,640
- Come on, is she...
- He's being very quiet, which always worries me.

87
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,040
Here's the expert, come on -
tell us. Is it a good idea?

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,640
- Old perma-tan.
- I'll tell you later.

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,080
For her two savoury flavours,

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,400
last week's Star Baker Candice
is combining garlic mushrooms

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
with sweet cured bacon to
fill heart-shaped Palmiers,

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
and caramelised red onion chutney

93
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,600
with walnuts and blue
cheese for her second.

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,720
You've got a lot of things
going on inside the Palmier.

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
Are you blitzing it or chopping it?

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,080
Not blitzing it, just cutting all
the ingredients up quite small.

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,240
It just gives it a little bit of bite.

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,080
- How thick are these going to be?
- Just over half an inch thick.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,280
- Quite thick, then.
- They've worked at home,

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
so I'm getting a nice
crisp and nice layers.

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
- No-one wants soggy Palmiers.
- NO-ONE wants soggy Palmiers.

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,480
- No!
- Look forward to it, then, Candice. - Thank you very much.

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm not worried, actually.
They've been all right at home.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,000
I think Candice and Jane are
the ones to beat this week.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,240
I don't know if Selasi feels the same.

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,880
The girls have been really, really,

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,160
really, really, really,
really, really, really strong.

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,480
- Morning, Jane.
- Good morning.

109
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,200
- What've you got? Is this the dough before the butter's gone in?
- Yes.

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm doing one with a
sort of flower shape...

111
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,840
So it's got a fold like that and
then a fold like that, and then

112
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,720
that's got pesto in it and that's
got sun-dried tomato paste in.

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
- A sort of puffy hand?
- Sort of a puffy flower, I like to think!

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,280
To go with her pesto and sun-dried
tomato flower-shaped Palmier,

115
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
garden designer Jane is also
making elephant ear-shaped Palmiers

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,440
filled with black olive tapenade,

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,920
with goat's cheese and Parma ham.

118
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,320
The last batch I made this week

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,960
failed spectacularly, really -

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
all the butter leaked out and
it was as tough as old boots.

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Feeling it here, today. Butterflies!

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,520
The key to getting your puff
right is chilling - I need

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,040
to work really quickly, cos I want
to have at least an hour for baking.

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
It's more crumbly than it is at home.

125
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,960
Hopefully it'll get better as I...

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,360
combine the layers.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,720
The pastry will need a
series of chills, rolls,

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,000
turns and folds to create the lamination.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Can't see any butter coming
through, which is a bonus.

130
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
This is...

131
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
..not looking great.

132
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
- Morning, Andrew.
- Morning. - Morning. - So?

133
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Er, so my puff pastry
isn't going quite to plan.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,960
- What's happened, do you think?
- I think it might be a little dry.

135
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,160
- What flour are you using?
- I'm using plain flour.

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
Andrew's making elephant ear-shaped
Palmiers, filled with roasted

137
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
red peppers and goat's cheese.

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
And, as a nod to his love of music,

139
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,280
he'll shape his second Palmiers
into treble clefs, which will be

140
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,880
flavoured with a blend of
fresh herbs and breadcrumbs.

141
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
When you say breadcrumbs,
they're fresh white breadcrumb?

142
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,160
- Yes, there's the breadcrumbs.
- No, those are raspings. Those are dried.

143
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,000
So you're saying your
pastry might be a bit dry,

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,120
- and then you've got breadcrumbs.
- DRIED breadcrumbs.

145
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
- Dried... I'm not going to argue with you, Mary!
- Good luck, Andrew.

146
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
Cheers, thank you.

147
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,440
I'm losing confidence
by the second in this,

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,880
but trying to remain optimistic.

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm just failing at the moment.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
With their dough chilling,

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,200
the bakers turn their
attention to their fillings.

152
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,520
She's very quiet over
there today, isn't she?

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
Bit focused.

154
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,920
I can hear you whispering!

155
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,640
Just a bit of rivalry going on here!

156
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,760
This is going to be my salmon fillet.

157
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to cook it first just
to get the liquid out of it.

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,520
- Morning, Selasi.
- Morning. - Tell us all about your... - Palmiers. Um...

159
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,840
- I'm making...
- He's finishing my sentences for me!

160
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
Getting ahead of himself!

161
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
That's what I was going
to ask you, but go on!

162
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,760
I'm doing a classic Palmier,
which will be about 1 cm thickness

163
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,840
and then the second one
will be a butterfly.

164
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,520
Selasi is hoping his
butterfly-shaped Palmiers

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,800
filled with piccante peppers,
red onion and sun-dried tomatoes,

166
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,320
and elephant ear-shaped Palmiers
crammed with chilli-infused salmon,

167
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,720
pesto and creme fraiche will
whet the judges' appetites enough

168
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
to book his place in the final.

169
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm just wondering whether
it's all going to stay crisp.

170
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,240
- It should be all right.
- Look at the great grin on his face!

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,000
You're obviously very confident,
I'm just waiting for the result.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,920
- He's winging it!
- Dude, you are winging it!

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,160
It just doesn't look like
puff pastry. I can't use it.

174
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,920
Ruddy disaster.

175
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,840
What can I do?

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,360
An hour gone. Bakers, two
hours left. It's two hours.

177
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Are you doing me out of a job, mate?!

178
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,360
- This is all I had!
- Sorry!

179
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
I was like the speaking clock,
but with puns, that's all we had!

180
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Do you want us to come and bake for you?

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Is that what you want, Selasi?!

182
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,080
- Want a quarter turn, want a book turn, mate?
- Yeah, we can do that.

183
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,320
It's over. I'm absolutely
furious with you.

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
An hour into the bake, and Andrew's
decided to take the gamble -

185
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
to restart his pastry from scratch.

186
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm just going to have to work quickly,

187
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
try and take a couple of short cuts.

188
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm not going to give up.

189
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
- Are these your secret notes?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,840
Mm, interesting. Week seven...

191
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Wear mulberry lip...

192
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,600
- Where's your lipstick, by the way?
- It's all come off!

193
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,920
- Candice, that's a worry. Can I help you, please? Come on.
- Gosh, OK.

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,000
Because you without lipstick
is not right. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,760
- It's semifinal, you can't let yourself down.
- I can't.

196
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
- OK, there?
- Yeah. It'll be rushed, but I'll get there.

197
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
So I did the first one uber-quick,

198
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,120
and then I did two and three together.

199
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,800
I might skip the last one, actually.

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,280
- Make sure you chill it before you bake it, though.
- Yeah, yeah.

201
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,800
It's going to go in the freezer.
I'm going to try and pull it back.

202
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,680
OK, bakers - one hour left.

203
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Which reminds me, it's
time for my next turn.

204
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Again, you don't want too much filling,

205
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,560
just enough so the judges can

206
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,720
actually taste the filling.

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,360
I do think you have to be fairly
generous with the filling.

208
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,040
Otherwise you don't get all the flavours.

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,280
So this is an egg wash,

210
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,040
which is going to stick my
breadcrumbs to my pastry.

211
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Let's get the folds right. It's
a complicated folding process.

212
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,680
So then you go that way...

213
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
..and then...that way.

214
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,640
In hindsight, I wouldn't have
picked such a complicated shape.

215
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,680
In hindsight, I would have done
a lot of things differently!

216
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,520
But we'll just keep calm and carry on,

217
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,960
cos that's the British thing to do.

218
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,840
I'll cut it in just
under centimetre slices.

219
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,360
I don't want it too thin, cos
then I'd lose the filling.

220
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,160
- So, um, do you want to win, Selasi?
- I really want to win.

221
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
I really want to get to the final.

222
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,120
- Are you feeling pressure from your family, as well?
- Yeah.

223
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,600
I need to make them proud.
I can't let them down.

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,760
- Are you about to cry, Selasi?
- Nah!

225
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,680
We'll leave the crying to Andrew.

226
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,920
He was looking a little bit
teary earlier, I have to say.

227
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,160
- I'm glad he's sorted it out now. So that's good.
- Yeah. He's good.

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Although, you don't want
him to sort it out TOO well,

229
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm just putting that in there.

230
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm relieved I redid the pastry.

231
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,640
Cos at least I think this is laminated.

232
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,960
This is my second set, I'm
just rolling in my nuts.

233
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,400
As it's getting closer to baking,

234
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm beginning to feel a
bit worried about it again.

235
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm just making them into a butterfly.

236
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,280
The sooner the bakers get their
Palmiers into the oven, the sooner

237
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,360
they can tell how successful
their pastry lamination has been.

238
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm just going to do my first batch.

239
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,280
She's always ahead of the
game, isn't she? Always!

240
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,960
Set the timer for about 8 minutes.

241
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,240
- OK...
- All good in the oven? - I think so, they're in.

242
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,920
- Yeah?
- Nothing I can do now.

243
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,840
They're all in.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Have you got a second batch to
go in? Another batch to go in?

245
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,920
No, I've basically got four trays in!

246
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,200
- Do you think you'll be last boy standing?
- Too early to say.

247
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
He's hard to beat, Selasi.
I mean, if you think...

248
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,960
You want to be the only
cock in the hen coop, mate.

249
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,120
I mean, on a pure Darwinian level.

250
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,920
If it had to come to that, I'm afraid...

251
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Sorry, Selasi!

252
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Oh!

253
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,240
The face of an angel -
underneath it, he's vicious!

254
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,680
- These smell good, don't they?
- Mm, they smell nice.

255
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah, they're looking all right.

256
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,240
That was almost a DVD
workout video we did, then.

257
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
A-a-nd...

258
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,040
Come on, little Palmiers.

259
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
- The next few minutes...
- Bake, bake, bake.

260
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,360
..will reveal if the bakers have
achieved the required lamination.

261
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,880
I just haven't been sleeping.

262
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,520
I lie awake, tossing and
turning, worried about my bakes.

263
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,120
It's ridiculous.

264
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,440
If this goes wrong, it's going to
be the thing that sends me home.

265
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,760
We're all right. The butter's not
leaking out, like it did midweek.

266
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,920
I've got the lamination, which is good.

267
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,800
I just want them to be cooked!

268
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,520
Want to get the next batch in.

269
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,880
Aaah!

270
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,280
- I've just lost three of my Palmiers!
- Oh, Jane!

271
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,520
Five-second rule.

272
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,640
Semifinalist bakers, you
have 15 minutes left.

273
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
Come on, hold together.

274
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm a bit worried about my second batch.

275
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh!

276
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,720
Are you OK?

277
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,600
- You all right?
- Yeah.

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll be all right.

279
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm amazed they've laminated with
that time. Absolutely gobsmacked.

280
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,640
These are raw.

281
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,760
Just don't want to dish up raw pastry.

282
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
- You OK, you manage to save them?
- They need to COOK.

283
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
Just not cooking.

284
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
I'm pleased with them.

285
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,640
I have got a little bit of onion
spillage, but I'm OK with that.

286
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Just cook, little Palmiers. Cook!

287
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
They're fine, they'll be absolutely
fine. They will be. Completely.

288
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,040
- The more we say it to ourselves, Jane...
- It will be...

289
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,920
It'll be absolutely fine.

290
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,960
- Selasi, is this is the first time you've been less than calm?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,720
- There's a lot of patrolling from you today.
- Very! - Yeah? - Yeah.

292
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,120
- Are you scared for the first time?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,360
- So I'll probably be taking them out 30 seconds...
- Really?

294
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
- So right to the wire?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
Two minutes on the clock, bakers.

296
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,640
Two minutes.

297
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,480
Come on, oven - do your stuff.

298
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,280
Another minute.

299
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,760
One minute, out - in the basket.

300
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,440
No problem. Hm!

301
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,320
Really pleased with the pastry.

302
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,920
Fire those off. I think they're
just about done. Just about.

303
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,720
30 seconds.

304
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,880
They're going to have to come out,
aren't they? There's nothing for it.

305
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,680
They're not crisp enough at all.

306
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,760
Definitely undercooked.

307
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,520
Look at that poor little one.
He's going to spot that, isn't he?

308
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,280
- Ten...
- Neuf... - Huit.

309
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,880
- Sept.
- Six. - Cinq.

310
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,320
- Quatre.
- Trois. - Deux.

311
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
C'est fini.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,960
Right, gang - move your baskets to
the ends of your benches, please.

313
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,920
Mary and Paul have asked for
24 Palmiers with two different

314
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,680
savoury flavours and shapes,

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,400
both with clearly defined layers
and perfectly cooked pastry.

316
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,240
- They look like frogs. They're lovely!
- Right, there you go, Mary.

317
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,880
Let's try one of these.

318
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll get the pesto bit.

319
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
They're not quite done,
but very good flavour.

320
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,360
When you use pesto and
sun-dried tomatoes,

321
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,840
they are steeped in oil, which
is likely to go into the pastry.

322
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Right. And this is the tapenade.

323
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,360
I think the flavour is perfect,
um, REALLY good, but again,

324
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,040
same problem - they're a little
bit soggy when you get inside.

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,720
The mushroom one, great shape,
great colour - quite thick.

326
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,600
Oh, good sound!

327
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,280
It's something I'd like for breakfast,

328
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,680
with bacon - they taste good,

329
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,200
they're a good colour and
they're beautifully crispy.

330
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,920
Let's move on to the caramelised
onion - there's so much filling

331
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,360
in there, it's bursting out.

332
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
Is that a pastry or is it a Palmier?

333
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,720
I can't really tell because
there's so much filling in there.

334
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,760
- You've lost the definition.
- Mm.

335
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,240
The pastry is beautifully
flaky, they're a nice flavour,

336
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,080
but I cannot see the
shape of the Palmier.

337
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,800
I think it tastes... One of the best
things I've had for a long time.

338
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,160
- But unfortunately, I wouldn't class it as a Palmier.
- Oh, OK.

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,680
- It needed longer in the oven, for sure.
- Yeah.

340
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
I was a little worried your salmon
flavour wouldn't come through,

341
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,560
in fact it has. But it's only
the outside that's crisp.

342
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,400
It's a bit untidy cos you're dealing
with something that's quite rough,

343
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,680
coarse. You're going to lose
the shape of the Palmier,

344
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,560
which is what's happened on a
few of these, such as that one.

345
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,000
- And they are underbaked.
- Yeah.

346
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,040
I rather like this shape. It's a bit
different. What's happened there?

347
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,960
It's not good, it's very soggy.

348
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
These are very...

349
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,760
As I look inside, they're very raw.

350
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,440
Not just underbaked -

351
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,680
that is raw in the middle,
there. Not baked at all.

352
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
- Flavour's great, though.
- Thank you. - Flavour's good.

353
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,800
They're beautifully displayed.

354
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,840
Underwear drawer, socks and
then... bras underneath, probably.

355
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,920
Did you have a second go at your pastry?

356
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,120
Yes, I started my second batch
of puff about an hour in,

357
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
- so I was quite pushed for time.
- But you've managed it!

358
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,280
Yeah, just about pulled
it off, hopefully.

359
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,480
- OK, this is the herb one with the breadcrumb, yeah?
- Yes.

360
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,640
You've got a good colour of bake
there. We've got quite a few layers.

361
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,560
Mm!

362
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,640
I like the flavour.

363
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,880
It's not very buttery, though.

364
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,840
Nice and crisp, though,
especially the crumb outside,

365
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,640
which you thought was going to
dry... It hasn't dried it out,

366
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,320
it's given a nice original finish to it.

367
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,200
- Right, this is the goat's cheese one, wasn't it?
- Yes. - This is crispy.

368
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,680
Now, that's much crispier than this one.

369
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,000
You can see all the layers,

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,560
see the crispness, and then you get
the intense flavour in the middle.

371
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,880
I love these, these are very, very
good. You've got away with this.

372
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,240
- Well done.
- Thank you. - Well done, Andrew.

373
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm just chuffed and relieved...

374
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,040
I mean, Paul saying, "Yeah, you
got away with that" - I really did!

375
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,760
I've been in that tent long enough

376
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,400
to know that those ovens don't
cook as fast as mine do at home.

377
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
Why don't I learn?

378
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,760
She did say the pastry was
beautifully flaky - that's

379
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,480
a nice comment coming from
Mary Berry. I hope it's enough.

380
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
I just need to kill it in the Technical.

381
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,360
One semifinal bake down,

382
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,080
two to go, and it's a lot to play for.

383
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,240
Got to do it.

384
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,840
Let's do it, Selasi - talk to yourself!

385
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,880
One challenge down, two to go...

386
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,240
..before Paul and Mary decide
which baker is heading home

387
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,680
and which three will
make it to the final.

388
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,440
Bakers, for your
Patisserie Week challenge,

389
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,080
we have a little something
set by Monsieur Paul.

390
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,160
Before we ask you to leave,
Paul, any words of advice?

391
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,360
Remember it's the semifinals,

392
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,720
so it's not only got to taste
good, it's got to look good, too.

393
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,040
Paul, I think you've got an
appointment at Banalities'R'Us,

394
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,360
just over there! If
you'd like to pop off...

395
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,800
Mary, we'll see you later.

396
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,320
Now, for your Technical Challenge,
Paul and Mary would like you

397
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,800
to make, please, one high-end Savarin.

398
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
It is all-singing, all-dancing,
we've got chocolate and syrup

399
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,200
and caramel and yeast - yes, yeast.

400
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,640
- You've got 2½ hours on this challenge.
- On your marks...

401
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,040
Get set. Bake.

402
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,920
This is kind of unknown territory.

403
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,160
I've heard of a Savarin.

404
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm just trying to picture it in my head.

405
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,400
Savarin is a round, yeasty cake
thing that you then soak with syrup.

406
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm not sure.

407
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,120
I've heard of it before, but
I don't think I've made it.

408
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Paul, why did you choose the Savarin?

409
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,960
Savarin's quite a tricky thing to
do. It's basically a yeasted cake.

410
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
Now, it's all down to the proving -

411
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800
if they take it too early, it
won't reach the top of the mould.

412
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,680
If they take it too late, it'll
balloon and mushroom over the side.

413
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,720
You'll note from this one, it's perfect.

414
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,840
- You see all the little marks from the top of the tin?
- Yeah.

415
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,880
That's the level it should be at and
that's what we'll be looking for.

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
And then it's about the liquor.

417
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
When we cut into this, we want to
see it moist all the way through.

418
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,040
Look at that, Mary!

419
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
What a beautiful, even texture.

420
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,800
You see the way the moisture's
dropped all the way down the cake?

421
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,440
Absolutely evenly from
the top to the bottom.

422
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
The Chantilly cream...

423
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,400
The vanilla complements the bit of
orange booze in it, it's lovely.

424
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,280
Do you know, I think our bakers
have been very lucky today.

425
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,640
Here they are having
a rich dough to rise -

426
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,040
it'll rise beautifully
in this gorgeous weather.

427
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,600
10 g of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt...

428
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,320
Never put the yeast and salt together,

429
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
cos the salt kills the yeast.

430
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
At least I know that one!

431
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm going to treat it like
I would an enriched dough.

432
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,160
So I've got my flour, sugar,

433
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,760
yeast, salt, eggs...

434
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm hoping that an all-in-one
method will be fine.

435
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Just melted my butter slightly down,

436
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,040
just to make a batter,

437
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,640
and when I make a batter,
I always melt my butter.

438
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,040
Totally making this up! Just trying
to think how I'll combine these.

439
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,520
I thought maybe I'd whip it,

440
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
but I think I'm going to
go with my dough hook.

441
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,600
- Because that's what I would use for dough.
- Using a whisk attachment.

442
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,560
I want it to be quite smooth.

443
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,320
I'm using a mixer and I'm
folding the ingredients in,

444
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm not beating it too much.

445
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,360
It's a cake. So you don't want to
over-beat the mix or the cake mix

446
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,240
or it goes a bit rubbery.

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,920
I've changed my attachment.

448
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,440
The dough hook just wasn't
working out in terms of mixing.

449
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,960
So I think we're going to leave
that. Let the yeast do its thing.

450
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Probably leave it out for 40 minutes...?

451
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,360
45 minutes...?

452
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,920
In this heat, half an hour. With luck.

453
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,720
Just says, "Leave to rise".

454
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
"Make the syrup."

455
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Full stop.

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,640
300 g of caster sugar. Juice of a lemon.

457
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,120
150 mill of water, and 100
mill of orange liqueur.

458
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Funnily enough,

459
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,360
the recipe doesn't say anything
about how thick it should be.

460
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,040
I want it so that it's
going to absorb in.

461
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,880
I think it should be fairly thin,
so that it penetrates through.

462
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
And then the next thing is...

463
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,520
Make a 7 cm oval disc
with the plain chocolate.

464
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,280
How on earth do you draw a 7 cm oval?

465
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,720
Is that right?

466
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
I think it's almost like a label.

467
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,280
Do not use sticky labels!
We use "chocolat"!

468
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,040
- It's really, really warm in here.
- It's quite intense, isn't it?

469
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,400
I think it's going to be hard for
the chocolate to set properly.

470
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,440
That's good. Thank you.

471
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,160
(Keep that.)

472
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
It's not as neat as I would like.

473
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,480
"Fill the Savarin tin with butter
and leave for a second rise."

474
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
I'm going to pour this in.

475
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,640
My second prove's about 20 minutes,
and I'm trusting it to then

476
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
puff up a bit more in the oven.

477
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
"Make caramel shards."

478
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
Going to try a bit of caramel, then,

479
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,600
because you know how
good I am at caramel!

480
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,240
Last time I made caramel it
didn't go too well, but I've been

481
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,440
very careful to sift my sugar
and clean the pan beforehand.

482
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,320
I've got my dreaded caramel to make.

483
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
That's not good.

484
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,240
It's crystallised.

485
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,600
Is that going to turn? Is it? Is it?

486
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,640
I think I'm going to have to
make another lot of caramel.

487
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,680
You take your eye off it
for a second and...it burns.

488
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,880
It's done it again!
So, let's try it AGAIN.

489
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,400
One, two...

490
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Pour, and then I'll shard afterwards.

491
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
- Andrew's caramel...
- Andrew's done it, I know.

492
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
- Look at Andrew's caramel.
- I know, I know. Don't get obsessed with him.

493
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,600
(He's obsessed with you, Jane.

494
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,440
(He is. You're all he talks about.)

495
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,240
Pop this in the tin now.

496
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,720
That's been proving for 50 minutes,
and it has easily doubled in size.

497
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,040
Just going to try and
level it a little bit.

498
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,920
I'm going to see how that
gets on with 30 minutes.

499
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,200
- What's going in there?
- White chocolate. - Good.

500
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
- And this is for piping the word "Savarin"?
- Yes.

501
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,960
Which kind of makes me a bit nervous.

502
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,560
You only get one chance at
piping, so it's kind of do or die.

503
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,160
Oh, this is very, very delicate stuff.

504
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,720
You've got a squashed N.

505
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
No-one wants a squashed N.

506
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
- Yes, my friend.
- We're getting there, aren't we? - Yes, my friend.

507
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,200
Aw, thanks.

508
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,960
I may have just got chocolate
on you, and I'm so sorry.

509
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,760
I really hope you haven't.

510
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
No, we're good.

511
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,560
If I don't go in now...

512
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,360
Otherwise it'll never,

513
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,480
ever get cooked and cooled.

514
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,760
How long do we go for,
do we go for 20 minutes?

515
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm going to give it 25 minutes,
but I'll check it before then.

516
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,960
"Prepare the fruit.

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,680
"Orange segments, mango, kiwi,
strawberries, pomegranate,

518
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,280
"blueberries and raspberries."

519
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,560
I'm going to cut my fruit in
various shapes and sizes...

520
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,720
select the best...

521
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,400
I'm just cutting out segments of orange,

522
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,040
attempting to do it much more
neatly than I would at home.

523
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,000
Bakers, halfway through on your Sava...

524
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,880
The first proof was an hour,
the second is 15 minutes,

525
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,280
but it's rather large.
And it will grow more.

526
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,720
I think I'm going to go in.

527
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,920
I'll just look at 25 minutes
and then keep an eye out.

528
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,600
20 minutes to start with.

529
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
It's looking absolutely huge.

530
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm glad I put it in the oven early.

531
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,200
Cos it means hopefully I
can at least get it cool.

532
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,600
- Go.
- She's always on time!

533
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,160
Major concern is getting
this Savarin cooked,

534
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,760
cos it is taking slightly
longer than anticipated.

535
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,440
Wow-ee.

536
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
Still not dark enough.

537
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,560
I think it's cooked.

538
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,320
Everyone is like, apart
from me at the moment.

539
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,640
"And then use all the syrup -
soak the warm Savarin". I read it.

540
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,680
I am going to...brush the top...

541
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,720
It hopefully melts and goes into it.

542
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,280
Then I'm going to turn it out,
do this around the sides...

543
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh, Jane, that looks good!

544
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,240
This is going to be one sticky Savarin.

545
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,280
Wow-ee!

546
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
Smells amazing!

547
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,400
Yeah, I think that's cooked.

548
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm going to try turning this out.

549
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,640
It's not quite taken
the top of the rim...

550
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,120
15 minutes, bakers. 15 minutes.

551
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Gives me enough time to
just... towel down Selasi.

552
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Thank you.

553
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,640
It will come as no surprise to anybody

554
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,000
that I'm having another go at caramel!

555
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,080
A lot of it is coming out the bottom.

556
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm waiting for my cake to cool.

557
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,920
It felt a bit warm. I can't risk
it with the cream, I really can't.

558
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,760
Unfortunately that is still warm.

559
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,800
Going to put this in the
freezer for two minutes.

560
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,880
Come along, caramel, do me a favour.

561
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,360
Bakers, it never Sava-rins,
it always Sava-pours.

562
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,000
Five minutes left.

563
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,160
Actually, no, I need to fill it.

564
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,400
I think I could be shard-less.

565
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,120
That's crystallised.

566
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,880
How is it everybody can
make caramel and I can't?

567
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,760
Going to go for some
sort of star arrangement,

568
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,680
and I'll do mango
radially coming outwards,

569
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,760
fill the gaps with
strawberries and raspberries,

570
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
caramel shards go in...

571
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,600
Still trying to think how I'm
going to decorate it, actually.

572
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,080
The cream's melting, it's so hot.

573
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
Keep the cream as cold as possible...

574
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,600
How long have we got?

575
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
A minute now, bakers, one minute.

576
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,320
Five seconds...

577
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,240
OK, bakers, time's up for
the yeasted ring of doom.

578
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,360
Step away.

579
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,680
Bring them up, please, and
put them behind your photos

580
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,840
for the judging to commence.

581
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,440
Mary and Paul are looking for a
well proved and baked Savarin,

582
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,240
perfectly penetrated with orange syrup,

583
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
decorated with fresh fruit and
a handwritten chocolate label.

584
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,280
We've got a bit of melting
going on with the cream,

585
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,920
but I think we can allow that, Mary.

586
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
Did you really say that?

587
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
Are you starting to be really nice?

588
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,240
Right.

589
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,320
Start with this one. The
decoration isn't bad,

590
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,200
there's a bit of sugar work in there.

591
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,400
The problem with this,
for me, it's the colour,

592
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
it's overdone. And it's under-proved.

593
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,120
You don't get a lot of definition.
If you prove it correctly,

594
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,400
it fills the mould, and
therefore you get a better shape.

595
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,160
- But let's get inside and see.
- OK.

596
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,480
It's quite close-structured.

597
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,680
And therefore, to penetrate that far down

598
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,640
the liquor's going to
find it difficult cos it's

599
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,120
so tight at the top. But
- what does it taste like?

600
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,200
Actually, it HAS got down there.

601
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,520
It's got a little bit down there.

602
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,000
- They've written "Savarin" beautifully...
- Yep.

603
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,960
..and that's difficult
in this heat, isn't it?

604
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
OK, move on.

605
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,320
We have a very similar problem here,

606
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,520
it's under-proved, and again
the bake is too strong.

607
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,920
It's slightly overdone,
probably by five minutes.

608
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,080
Now, the decoration, I think, is good

609
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,400
and they've bothered to take
the membrane off the orange,

610
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,800
- which gives a nice finesse to it.
- Let's see what it's like inside.

611
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
That bit was soaked beautifully.

612
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
It's gone in the bottom
where they've soaked it,

613
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,120
poured it down, and it's drawn
into the bottom of the cake,

614
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,520
but actually, bang in the
middle, there's nothing.

615
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,480
Right. Moving on to the next one.

616
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,200
Now, it's inconsistent in colour.

617
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
It's almost like it
wasn't mixed properly,

618
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
so you've got a light bit and a dark bit.

619
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,080
But the decoration, they've
got the "Savarin" on the top,

620
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,960
but for me they've just
chopped up an orange

621
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
and dumped it on the top. They
haven't even segmented it.

622
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,640
No, the membrane's all
round the orange, isn't it?

623
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,320
You can see the top there where
it's gone down to about here.

624
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,360
That's very visible that
it's only soaked in the top.

625
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,680
There's nothing in the middle.

626
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,920
OK. Move on to the last one.

627
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,000
Now, actually, I love the colour of this.

628
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,960
It's slightly under-proved,
and you can see where it hasn't

629
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,720
shaped into the moulds at the bottom.

630
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,560
But the colour is perfect.

631
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,440
- Mind you, the shards...
- But...

632
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,440
- ..have crystallised.
- Yes.

633
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,800
The "Savarin"'s been written
well, it's neat, it's tidy,

634
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,720
it's uniform, but I think we
need to look into it as well.

635
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,240
Let's have a look.

636
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,560
It looks as though it hasn't quite
gone through to the middle again.

637
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,160
Mm.

638
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,440
- Plenty on the outside.
- Mm.

639
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,320
There is a little bit in the middle.

640
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,600
OK...

641
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,800
But which of our semifinalists
has baked the perfect Savarin?

642
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
So, in fourth place...

643
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,240
It's a little bit overbaked,
and the orange has not had

644
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,000
its membrane removed.

645
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
In third place is this one.

646
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,560
Too dark, just overbaked. Again,
quite tight inside as well.

647
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,800
It just needed more proving.

648
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
In second place...

649
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,440
..this one.

650
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,120
Good caramel, a little
bit overbaked still.

651
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,720
And in first place is this one.

652
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,600
- Well done, Jane.
- Well done, Jane.

653
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,480
The colour on this is perfect.
That's exactly the colour

654
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,720
it should be. Decoration was very good.

655
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,960
Oh, wow!

656
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,520
How did I do that? How did I do that?

657
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,480
That's disappointing.

658
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,200
I nailed it as well.

659
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Had I done well in this Technical,
I think I'd be all right,

660
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,680
but coming last is very risky.

661
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,760
Today, from the depths of
despair, I feel like I'm soaring

662
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,000
on a bit of a high. Today's
actually been quite a good one.

663
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,840
I did my best, I really
did my best in that.

664
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,280
It's still all to play for tomorrow.

665
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,240
It's a long challenge, a lot
to do, a lot to prove tomorrow.

666
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,560
(We can really do this.)

667
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,000
So, two quite fiendish
challenges. Who did well?

668
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,280
Andrew and Jane were above the
others. And surprise, surprise,

669
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,200
because he made his puff pastry again.

670
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,720
- I know.
- But it worked.

671
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,400
Jane and Candice, I'd put them
actually equal in the Signature,

672
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,480
and the reason for that
is Jane's were not baked.

673
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,680
Mary doesn't entirely agree
with you by the looks of it.

674
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,720
Well, I was going to say that Candice,

675
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,960
when you actually looked at
them, you couldn't see the

676
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
definition of the layers of Palmier
because she had so much filling.

677
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,960
It's fair to say that
Selasi's butterflies were raw.

678
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,000
Selasi is really going to
have to pull up his socks.

679
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,800
One show-stopping bake now
stands between these four bakers

680
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,200
and a place in the final.

681
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,920
Good morning, semifinalist bakers
and welcome to your semifinal

682
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Showstopper Day. Now, listen
up. Today, Paul and Mary

683
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,480
would love for you to
make 36 fondant fancies.

684
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,760
Two different types of fondant fancy -

685
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,120
genoise sponge, buttercream and
fondant, all made from scratch.

686
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,320
You have four and a half
hours on this challenge.

687
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,000
- On your mark...
- Get set... - And bake.

688
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,360
36 individual fondant fancies,
four and a half hours.

689
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,800
Yeah - walk in the park.

690
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,920
Time really is a challenge today.

691
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,760
It's very important for me
to nail this Showstopper.

692
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,960
I have to nail it.

693
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,000
I want to see shop-standard
fondant fancies.

694
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,280
It may look easy, cos you think
it's just a sponge and fondant,

695
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,240
but each component
part has to be perfect.

696
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,120
I want to see flat sides, I want
to see them beautifully smooth,

697
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,440
I want to see them glossy.

698
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,400
The real difficulty is the
genoise sponge, because

699
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
in the real world you'd
make them the day before

700
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,400
so the sponge is firmed up.

701
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,080
Their sponge is coming
out of the oven, cooled

702
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
and then cut.

703
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,680
It'll be so difficult to
get neat, sharp shapes.

704
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,200
We want sheer perfection.

705
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,160
Genoise isn't my sponge
of choice, for sure.

706
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,840
I do have to get this right.

707
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,800
If it doesn't go right,
I'll make it again.

708
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,360
I've just chosen flavours,
really, that the kids love.

709
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,800
So I'm doing a pistachio
sponge with a raspberry curd

710
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,560
and a raspberry buttercream.

711
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,280
Jane will cut her pistachio
sponge into heart shapes,

712
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,760
before filling with a raspberry curd
and covering with raspberry fondant.

713
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,880
Her second fancies will use lemon
curd to add zest to her sponge.

714
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,960
- Hello, Jane.
- Good morning, Jane. - Morning.

715
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,880
Tell us a little bit about
how you're doing the fondant.

716
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,040
- I dip using my potato masher.
- Nice.

717
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,160
Are you a pourer? You're a
dipper then, not a pourer.

718
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,320
I'm a dipper.

719
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,040
Are you a dipper, dunker or pourer, Mary?

720
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,560
- I think I'm a pourer.
- Pourer. - But I think that's quite a clever idea.

721
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,760
You've got to do well
on the last Showstopper.

722
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Good advice from Paul.
Do well, don't do badly.

723
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,560
Do well.

724
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,040
This is the final challenge,
to get to the final, so...

725
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,520
everyone's sort of ready
to bring their A-game.

726
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,400
This one is going to be kind
of Victoria sponge-inspired...

727
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
So it's going to be a vanilla genoise,

728
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,040
raspberry jam and a vanilla buttercream.

729
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,880
Andrew's Victoria sandwich
fancies may be simple,

730
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,280
but together with his
chocolate and coffee fancies,

731
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,480
he's hoping to create a philharmonic
fondant orchestra of cakes,

732
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
decorating each of his 36 fondant fancies

733
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,280
with sheet music and bow ties.

734
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
There is a musical theme to this,

735
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm calling these my
philharmonic fondants.

736
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm going to do orchestra
players and then a choir,

737
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,520
with sheet music behind.

738
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
I've not done this to time at home.

739
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,240
A lot of elements, so the quicker
I can get this sponge done...

740
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,720
The shallower the cake tins, the
quicker the sponges will bake...

741
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,560
So all I'm going to do with
this is just gently tilt it.

742
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,120
..allowing more time for cooling,

743
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,800
coating and then covering
with fondant icing.

744
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,680
It's fine. It's just going in.

745
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,920
I think some of the other bakers
are using Swiss roll tins,

746
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,040
so theirs are going to cook
and cool quicker than mine.

747
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,800
I didn't even consider doing that,

748
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,640
I got this idea of making a
couple of big ones in my head,

749
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,720
and I haven't wavered from that path.

750
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,200
First batch in the oven,
ten minutes. That's it.

751
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,320
And I need to do my second batch.

752
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,360
- Hi, Candice.
- Hello.

753
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,200
Your two genoise, are they
exactly the same recipe?

754
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,280
No, one of them is a chocolate genoise,

755
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,800
and the other one is an
almond-flavoured genoise.

756
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Candice is hoping to book
HER place in the final

757
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,920
with a chocolate praline fondant fancy,

758
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,680
and a cherry Bakewell-inspired
fancy, decorated with lilac-coloured

759
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,640
icing, and a liqueur-soaked
cherry surprise in the middle.

760
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,400
- This are your cherries.
- Yep.

761
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,360
How are you going to thicken that?

762
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
I didn't want it any thicker than that.

763
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,680
Because what I do is actually
put the cherries in whole

764
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,760
into the middle, with a
little bit of the juice,

765
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,400
and the juice soaks into the sponge.

766
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
So this will go into that hole...

767
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,520
- Yeah.
- ..and the juice will go down like a drizzle?

768
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,880
- Yes. But not a huge amount, so it doesn't saturate the sponge.
- Right.

769
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
- The thing is, you've got to get it finished on time.
- Yeah.

770
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,320
- Bonne chance.
- Merci beaucoup!

771
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,640
They're always telling me I do
too much, but, yeah, semifinal!

772
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,960
That looks good.

773
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,960
Not ready yet.

774
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,880
- Hello, Selasi.
- Good morning.

775
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,560
Now, you've never had a
great Technical Challenge.

776
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,120
Yeah. I know it!

777
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,640
- Now, coming into the Showstopper...
- Yeah.

778
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,280
- ..I want you to do well, mate.
- Cheers. - I really do.

779
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,680
Selasi's hoping to do well
by going small and delicate

780
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,080
with his lime and
ginger-flavoured fancies,

781
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,400
and vanilla and raspberry
Prosecco velvet fancies,

782
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,520
with a bright pink sponge.

783
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,160
Fascinating colour. Little bit of...

784
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,240
- Oh, no, I just did that, just to check that.
- Oh, right, you did that.

785
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,120
It's a bit of a split.

786
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,720
Did you sieve your flour?

787
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,680
I never really sieve
my flour, even at home.

788
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,880
If you don't sieve your flour,

789
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,320
- sometimes you get pockets of flour...
- Yeah. - ..in the genoise.

790
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,840
- Thanks, Selasi.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

791
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,240
I'm making my sponge again, cos...

792
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,800
Mary made a comment.

793
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,440
"You didn't sieve your flour." That
means she's going to be looking

794
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,120
for air pockets, so that's
why I'm doing it again.

795
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,320
I've lost a little time, but
that's a risk I'm willing to take.

796
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,040
An hour of the bake has already gone.

797
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,840
I'm going to leave that for five minutes

798
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,120
then whack it in the freezer.

799
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,400
It's about getting everything
chilled down in time.

800
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,440
This looks so much better.

801
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm a bit behind, cos I had
to make my sponge again.

802
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,880
Right, going in.

803
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,320
Now, this is a good moment, this is
like an '80s pop video, isn't it?

804
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Suddenly it's all very, very Ultravox.

805
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,960
- Who needs a smoke machine?
- I know.

806
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,120
- And I've just breathed most of that in, thanks for that(!)
- Yeah, me too!

807
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,360
Sorry!

808
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,160
This is going to be my buttercream

809
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,240
that's going in the vanilla fondants...

810
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,600
I'm going to divide this in between
two, and oomph up the lemon in one

811
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,520
and add some raspberry to the other.

812
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,080
The second batch is going to be
lime and ginger genoise sponge.

813
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,440
Mary's watching. Make sure...

814
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,880
..I'm doing it right.

815
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,120
So now, hopefully, she won't
be looking for air pockets.

816
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,160
This is the semifinal.

817
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,280
You know, there's a certain look
of dedication on everybody's faces.

818
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,840
I think fondant fancies is a
fantastic challenge for a semifinal.

819
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,200
These are very, very flimsy.

820
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,840
You can see just they're
very fiddly little items.

821
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,400
I mean, the heart-shaped
one can be quite tricky.

822
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,080
Because of the bend on the top
of the heart, where it comes in,

823
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,000
creates a crease, if you're not straight,

824
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,800
that shows up a huge amount of problems.

825
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,360
So I'll be looking to see how
neat those hearts are going to be.

826
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,560
Second one is good, I'm happy with that.

827
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,600
As the other bakers' final sponges
are ready to come OUT of the oven...

828
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
- Sponge has actually risen!
- SHE LAUGHS

829
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,200
..Selasi's is only just going in.

830
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,400
I'm really, really behind.
But I'll be all right.

831
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,560
Bakers, as I said to
Idris Elba last weekend,

832
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,720
you have two and a quarter
hours to tickle my fancy.

833
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,400
Halfway through, bakers.

834
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,160
The ones you buy in the shop
don't have anything in the middle.

835
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,560
So these are like a nice
little hidden surprise.

836
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,640
To achieve a perfect finish on
their fondant icing, the bakers

837
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,480
must first cover their sponges with
an even crumb coat of buttercream.

838
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,600
It's fiddly. I don't like this bit.

839
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,000
The first two are fun,

840
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,640
and the remaining 34 are
an exercise in endurance.

841
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,960
My buttercream is going to
go in the hole in the middle,

842
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,520
and not on the outside or on the top.

843
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,280
Because I found that
just so time-consuming.

844
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,360
They may be mini cakes,
but this is a massive job.

845
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm giving them a reasonable
bit of individual attention,

846
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
until I'm roughly happy
with their appearance.

847
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,760
But if I perfected each one, I could
spend double the time on each one.

848
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,520
Which I don't have.

849
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,720
Say you spent five minutes on each one,

850
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,520
that's three hours.

851
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
There's a lot to get done.

852
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,520
I don't think I'll ever make these again.

853
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,640
Can I just say, I'm loving
your fondant straddle.

854
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,000
You're going to end up
with thighs of steel.

855
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,800
You are anchoring in there, mate.

856
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,560
Come on, CB.

857
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,600
This is not a comfortable
position or activity.

858
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
I've got a bit of stamina.

859
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,040
I'm the baking athlete.

860
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,080
Bakers, you'll find out

861
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,480
if your fondant fancies are
fantastic enough for the final

862
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,920
in half an hour.

863
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,120
Always time for a cup of tea.

864
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,720
Half an hour, bakers.

865
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,760
I'm going to start dipping them in...

866
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,680
This is a critical part of the bake.

867
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,120
And pour...

868
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,080
Pouring the fondant will reveal
who has achieved the smooth sides

869
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,400
that Mary and Paul are looking for.

870
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,760
My coating technique is trying
to make sure that the whole thing

871
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,720
is covered, and then it
travels nicely down the sides.

872
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,240
Hi, Mary. You all right?

873
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,320
Did you ever think, when you
were growing up, that one day you

874
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,960
would be making tiny, pastel pink
sponge cubes to entertain people?

875
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,720
To entertain people!

876
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,240
There is a danger that you might
end up with little bits of sponge

877
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,560
in your fondant, but it's a
risk worth taking, to be honest.

878
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,040
Phew!

879
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,520
I'm feeling the pressure,
I am feeling the pressure.

880
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,320
This is the pale green that's
going over my lemon fondants.

881
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,800
There we go. Round two.

882
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,400
These are my lime ones.

883
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,800
They're better than the vanilla
ones, I think. So much better.

884
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,720
But there's nothing I can do now.

885
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,080
This definitely gets very repetitive.

886
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,680
They're all covered.

887
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,120
So I've got all my elements,
it's just the decorating.

888
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,160
Oopsie.

889
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,200
I'm not happy with them.

890
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,120
They're definitely not perfect!

891
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,880
But...I will finish it.

892
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,120
Bakers, that's 15 minutes on
your resplendent fondants.

893
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,040
I haven't got my decorations done.

894
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,000
Still doesn't give me enough
time, but...we can try it.

895
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,240
But - let's get all
with some decoration on.

896
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,120
This is the almond buttercream.

897
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,560
- Breathe.
- Breathing, breathing, breathing!

898
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,320
- And...breathe...
- This is a speed thing.

899
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,360
Three, six, nine, ten.

900
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,400
11, 12, 13, 14...

901
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,880
Two, four, six, eight, ten, 12...

902
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,800
This is actual insanity.

903
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,600
Semifinalists, five on
your fondant fancies.

904
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,280
Five minutes on your fondant fancies.

905
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,200
(So messy! They're so messy!)

906
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,120
I'm still going to present
something. We don't give up.

907
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,000
In my household.

908
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,800
It's OK. It's OK.

909
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,560
Think, CB, think.

910
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,680
I can't do any more now, so...

911
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,080
that is how it will have to be.

912
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,000
This is manic. Absolutely manic.

913
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,360
Fondant and fanciable semifinalists...

914
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,600
the bake's over. Step away
from your bakes, please.

915
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,720
My fondant is just oozing.

916
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
Candice, do you want to
bring your Showstopper up?

917
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,520
It's a very nice display.

918
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,720
You chose to do an awful lot of work,

919
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,160
and looks as though it's worked out.

920
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,680
I think the praline ones, with the
nuts on the end, look quite nice.

921
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,000
A little bit messy at the bottom,

922
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,680
they could have done with tidying up.

923
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,240
It was just time at the end, yeah.

924
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,480
So let's try the praline ones first.

925
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,560
Now, that DOES look exciting
when you cut inside.

926
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,040
A lovely surprise there in the middle.

927
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,440
A beautiful, textured sponge,

928
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,120
and the right amount of
fondant round the outside.

929
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,840
There's nowt wrong with that!

930
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,520
- The flavours all go well together.
- Thank you. - It's beautiful.

931
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,920
- I think your textures are spot on.
- Thank you very much.

932
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,520
Looks pretty good. Right...

933
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,400
- Well, that's soft.
- Ooh!

934
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,320
It's neat...

935
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,960
I was really worried, when you
were putting that sponge in,

936
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,720
with all the runny liquid round
the outside. But you clever girl,

937
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,840
it has not bled into the genoise sponge.

938
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,640
Let's see what it tastes like.

939
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,560
It's a beautiful genoise, actually.
The flavours are fantastic.

940
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,040
You've made two cracking fondant fancies.

941
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,720
They don't LOOK so brilliant,
but they're stunning.

942
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

943
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,560
Thank you very much.

944
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,560
It's very dainty.

945
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,280
They're quite small as well,

946
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,840
- if I'm honest.
- I didn't want to do a big one,

947
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,880
because I've had a problem
with big bakes in the past.

948
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,640
You've got a lovely
shine on the butterflies.

949
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,800
But it's a bit of a matt
finish with the flowers.

950
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,200
And the genoise is peeking through
where the icing isn't even.

951
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,720
OK. Let's try this top one.

952
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,760
This is the...?

953
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,560
Vanilla pink velvet with
white chocolate icing.

954
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,080
I'm not madly excited by the flavour.

955
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,360
I know it's white chocolate,

956
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,880
but it's not really coming through
to me. It's just very, very sweet.

957
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,280
It's VERY sweet.

958
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,200
I think the sponge is
baked to perfection,

959
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,440
- if I'm honest, I think the sponge is fantastic.
- Cheers.

960
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,160
It's not particularly good fondant,

961
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,600
it's just sweetness with
a great sponge inside.

962
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,640
Right. Let's try the butterfly.

963
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,040
Can you remind us of this one again?

964
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,680
- And that's lime and ginger.
- Lime and ginger. - Maybe don't try the icing.

965
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,880
- Don't try the icing!
- It's too sweet. - It's too sweet.

966
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,320
- They're quite thin, aren't they?
- Yeah.

967
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
There's very little sponge here...

968
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,600
The sweetness is there.

969
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,640
But then the tang coming in is beautiful.

970
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,160
That's a potent lime, that.

971
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,400
It's lovely, it's not as
sweet as the last one.

972
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,440
Thanks, Selasi.

973
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,040
The biggest fault is obviously all
the crumb has come on the outside,

974
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,240
so when you poured the fondant
on, it's going to crumble,

975
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,200
it's gone to the side, and you
can see every single crumb.

976
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,600
I know.

977
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,320
But it's important for them to
look very smart and tempting.

978
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,760
All right, we'll start with the hearts.

979
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,680
Let's have a look.

980
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,840
Lovely.

981
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,920
Very neat. Sponge looks good.

982
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,400
Marzipan, buttercream, and
then that's the raspberry...?

983
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,560
That's the curd, yeah,
the raspberry curd.

984
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,160
Very good rise on your genoise as well.

985
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,960
The flavours go well together,

986
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,640
- but it's just so sad you didn't put something on the outside.
- Yes.

987
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,880
Now, lemon should win.

988
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,240
- Cos it's bit of a favourite of both Mary's and mine, actually.
- Hope so!

989
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,000
Now, the lemon's coming through.

990
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,280
But, you see, it needs something sharp,

991
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,120
because a fondant fancy is so sweet.

992
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,520
So if you have something sharp,
it just brings it all together.

993
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,560
It's a shame. The top looks good,

994
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,480
just the side's let
you down a little bit.

995
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,920
- Yeah.
- But the flavours are good, the flavours are good. - Sorry.

996
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,560
The presentation is stunning.

997
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,160
Both of them, you've gone simple,
which, in a way, is a good idea.

998
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,520
You're got a good finish on
the fondant of the coffee ones.

999
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,200
As we come down, the jam is
pouring out of the lower ones.

1000
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,280
Have you got buttercream on
the outside before you put

1001
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,000
- the fondant on?
- Yes, I did.

1002
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,560
It was maybe a little thin in places,

1003
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,360
which is probably why
you can see the jam.

1004
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,400
I think what we'll do is we'll
start with the vanilla...

1005
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,960
Good jam, good sponge, good flavour.

1006
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,560
Sharp and to the point.

1007
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,240
Textures are excellent.

1008
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,320
Let's try this mocha one.

1009
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,360
Cuts well.

1010
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,600
There's a little bit too
much buttercream for me.

1011
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,880
In a way, wise, to get
that lovely finish,

1012
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,360
but when you come to eat it,
it's a little bit too buttery.

1013
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,760
Textures are good.

1014
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,480
The mocha coming through
works really well, actually.

1015
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,240
Which one took your fondant fancy, Mary,

1016
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,640
which was your favourite today?

1017
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,560
Well, Candice, I have never
tasted better flavours.

1018
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,200
She really pushed the boat out.

1019
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,160
If it was tidier around the side,

1020
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,800
she would have done much
better on appearance.

1021
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,440
Andrew did incredibly
well on the first day.

1022
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,080
Has this challenge lived
up to expectations?

1023
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,040
He's done very well with this
challenge. Because he went simple.

1024
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,120
He's up for Star Baker,

1025
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,800
I think Candice has to be
up there as well. Selasi...

1026
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,160
What can you say about Selasi?

1027
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,880
Those are a little bit basic.

1028
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,800
And of course, they are
just a little bit clumsy.

1029
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,880
Jane had a bit of an issue with
her tidiness, didn't she, Mary?

1030
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,000
She didn't coat the
outsides with buttercream.

1031
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,960
And really, when you look at them,

1032
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,480
they're very, very
lumpy round the outside.

1033
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,680
Bakers, I've got the great job.

1034
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,440
I get to announce which one of
you is to be Star Baker this week.

1035
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,480
I may not be Mystic Meg,
but I read your Palmier,

1036
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,320
and I saw that your Savarin
was going to be incroyable,

1037
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,080
and your fondant fancies
were going to be fantastique.

1038
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,840
Mystery Star Baker,
mystery no more, you are...

1039
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,800
- ..Andrew.
- Yeah! - Well done. - Well done!

1040
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,200
Well done, Andrew.

1041
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
I have the less pleasant task this week.

1042
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,840
And I know that this is a really
hard week for anyone to leave.

1043
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,280
And so it's with real, incredible
sadness that this week...

1044
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,600
we say goodbye to...

1045
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
..Selasi.

1046
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,200
- Who we just love!
- We love.

1047
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,760
I'm using this as an excuse to get
very, very close to you, Selasi.

1048
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,560
- I want to get closer..
- Get off, get off him!

1049
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,920
- Aw!
- Selasi!

1050
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,520
It's a massively great achievement,
personally and for my family

1051
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,120
for getting this far in the semifinals.

1052
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,840
Come on, bring it in again. He's mine.

1053
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,960
It's been absolutely...
yeah, amazing, splendid.

1054
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,400
Splendid. Loved it all.

1055
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,720
No-one's more sad than me
to say goodbye to Selasi.

1056
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,120
What a character, what a baker.

1057
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,840
I'm very proud of Selasi,
I think he's a great baker.

1058
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,880
And he'll carry on doing it, you know.

1059
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,480
I don't have words, I really
don't. I could cry, actually!

1060
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,200
And I haven't being
close to crying all day!

1061
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,160
- Welcome to the final.
- Thank you so much.

1062
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,280
I'm so proud of myself. So happy!

1063
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,480
Feels absolutely incredible
to be in the final.

1064
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,080
And to get Star Baker as well,
I really wasn't expecting that.

1065
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,600
Yes!

1066
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,640
Ten weeks ago, 12
bakers entered the tent.

1067
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,400
Come into the Mel/Sue sandwich.

1068
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,520
One by one...

1069
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,960
- Michael.
- ..we bid them farewell.

1070
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,280
- I reached my limit.
- I knew it was coming.

1071
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,080
- Tom.
- Benjamina.

1072
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,560
I'd have loved to be in the
final, but we can't all go.

1073
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,240
Now, just three remain.

1074
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,480
Right, calm down now.

1075
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,680
But who will be crowned the winner

1076
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,360
of The Great British Bake Off 2016?

1077
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,880
The winner is...
