1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
- Last time...
- Very floral. 
- ..it was Botanical Week.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,360
This is a complete mess.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,920
After a disappointing start...

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,840
I guess I would have liked it to be a bit stiffer.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,200
..Rav and Andrew were on a rescue mission.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,160
Mine is so wet.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,960
As emotions ran high, it was Andrew who survived.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,760
And Rav was sent home.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,040
I've always said that I'm like a cat with nine lives

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,360
and my lives were running out!

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,760
Despite Candice's impressive cake for all seasons,

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,840
and Selasi's perfect sponge and piping,

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,240
it was Tom who stole the Star Baker crown for a second time.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,520
Great jasmine flavour in there. That's impressive.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,600
Now, it's Dessert Week.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Let's add some sugar.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,160
A Signature that's all about the swirl.

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,080
This is always so hard.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,440
A Technical that's all about the nuts.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,760
Ohhhhh!

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,280
And a mini Showstopper that's a massive challenge.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
The moment of truth.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
- Oh, no...!
- Disaster.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
Over the next two days,

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,640
the bakers will be tested on a trio of desserts.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Three challenges,

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
three chances to win Star Baker and avoid leaving the tent.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,080
So last week, obviously, I had a bit of a meltdown, so, yeah,

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,720
no, I had a little word with myself.

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
This week is more my type of week,

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm a desserts man through and through.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,720
I will try extra hard, yeah, Star Baker's been pretty allusive.

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,720
To have got this far is unbelievable.

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,920
I love them all, but I've now got so close I want to win!

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
You definitely have to impress on every three bakes because

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
there really is nowhere to hide now.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,040
So far, being Star Baker has not been great for me,

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,280
I've had a bit of the curse of the Star Baker in the past,

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,760
so I'm just going to try and ignore that.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
Bakers, just six remaining.

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Or as Mel and I like to say,

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,000
46.1538% of a baker's dozen, don't we, Mel?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,040
- We love that.
- We love it.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Anyway, enough of that.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
What Paul and Mary would love you to make

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,800
for your Signature Challenge, is a family-sized roulade.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Yes, the roulade can be filled in any which way you like,

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,240
- but it must be sweet.
- Yes. 
- And sponge.
- Yes.
- Not meringue.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,840
You've got an hour and a half on the clock. On your marks...

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,520
- Get set... BOTH:
- Bake.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
Ah, yeah, here we go again.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,920
It's a new week, fresh start, hopefully I can start the

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,520
week off with a really positive note with this roulade.

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah, we're getting closer to the final now,

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,200
so, every little counts and no silly mistakes, I guess.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Practised a lot this week, so I'm reasonably confident but

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,120
having a failure could be a quick ticket to the way home.

58
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,320
- MARY:
- One of the key characteristics of a roulade

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,800
is that you should, when it's rolled up, have a nice spiral,

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,360
like a Catherine wheel. Now, that needs skill.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,080
- PAUL:
- Think of a roulade like a good sandwich.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,720
If you put too much filling in it,

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
you're not going to get it in your mouth.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,200
I might, but most people wouldn't.

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,520
So the idea is to put a nice, even layer of filling all the way

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,360
through, and again that helps with the swirl as well.

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,320
A traditional roulade is a fairly simple-looking bake.

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,520
But with a place in the quarterfinals at stake, this is an

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,000
opportunity for the bakers to roll out something really special.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,800
- ANDREW:
- I'm drawing a straight pattern on my roulade

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,680
which I'll then freeze, to hint at the orange

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
which will be inside the sponge.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,200
The danger is, if you overcook the sponge a fraction,

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
it cracks when you roll it.

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
To help avoid any cracks, most of the bakers are making

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,960
a variety of whisked, fatless sponges.

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,840
So I'm going to be whisking some eggs and sugar together.

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,400
I want it to be really light and also I find it rolls

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
a bit easier than kind of more traditional sponges.

80
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,520
All the raising agent comes from the eggs, so whipping up the yolks,

81
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,560
whipping up the whites, that is going to make it rise.

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
Selasi's the only baker adding butter to his sponge mixture.

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Just melted butter, which I'm going to fold into the sponge.

84
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,760
It doesn't make it too dry, it gives a nice texture as well.

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
- Hello, Selasi.
- Morning.
- Hello!

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,440
Right, tell us all about your roulade.

87
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm making a lemon and strawberry roulade.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,760
It will have a cream filling and also lemon curd.

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,280
Selasi's classic summer ingredients of fresh strawberries and cream

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,720
will be layered with his own lemon curd to add extra zest

91
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,960
to the filling, then rolled in a plain sponge and finished

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,200
with piped whipped cream and nuts.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,240
What sort of finish do you get on your roulade?

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,040
- Does it crack at all? 
- I'm using a Genoise sponge,

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,120
which is a bit more tolerant to the rolling.

96
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,480
I would say that having the butter addition means that you've

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,160
- got a very pliable mixture.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,600
So I'm hoping there will be no crack whatsoever.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
- HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY 
- Um...

100
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,000
- TOM:
- I'm just putting a very small amount of nutmeg into my sponge.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
It's just a kind of aroma that works quite well with

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
chocolate and caramel.

103
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,000
Tom, tell us about your roulade.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm making a millionaire's roulade,

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,040
so it's based around a traditional millionaire's shortbread.

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,880
It's going to have chocolate and shortbread incorporated in it as well.

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
I will marry you.

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Last week's Star Baker, Tom,

109
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,520
is making a nutmeg-flavoured sponge filled with his own shortbread,

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,440
which he'll sprinkle over a layer of salted caramel, before

111
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,840
rolling and covering the entire roulade with chocolate ganache.

112
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,600
Millionaire's shortbread is stunning, but inside a sponge?

113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Should be interesting.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Do you mean that in a sort of, genuinely it'll be interesting

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,280
or in a sort of mwa-ha-ha-hah, classic creepy Paul Hollywood

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,400
something-awful's-going-to-happen kind of way?

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Errrr...

118
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,040
Baking time is crucial.

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Right, going in.

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Too little, and the sponge will be underbaked.

121
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Seven to nine minutes is all it takes.

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,680
Too much, and the sponge will dry out and crack when rolled.

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,240
My sponge is in the oven, for 15 minutes,

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,640
potentially up to about 20.

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,440
Right. Filling.

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm making a pina colada roulade.

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
It's a bit cheesy, but, you know, they're fun.

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Benjamina's bringing memories of cocktails on holiday to her roulade,

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
with a filing of pineapple soaked in coconut rum, layered with

130
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,520
coconut mascarpone and all rolled up in a coconut-flavoured sponge.

131
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,440
- And you said you had coconut in there?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,680
- What have you got in flavour? 
- Coconut extract paste.

133
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,440
- OK.
- Oooh.
- Oh, that's interesting. 
- It's really good, it's quite strong.

134
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
- Wow, it is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

135
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
That's like you're actually putting it on your skin.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,680
- I was going to say, get you up to that nice teak colour.
- Nice smell.

137
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Are you putting any of the pineapple inside?

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,480
I just cooked it down for a bit, with a bit of the rum.

139
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Looks good, happy with it. Nice and airy texture.

140
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,840
Yeah, it's looking fine, I think.

141
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
It's got to come out very shortly.

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
BEEPING

143
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,040
(Hot, hot! Hot!)

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,720
No pressure... I don't think it will crack, but if it DOES crack,

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
you know, it's all part of the charm.

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
So I'm making a tropical holiday roulade.

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm using my dad's recipe. It will have some banana in the centre,

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,280
and then there's going to be passion fruit caramel on top.

149
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
After tears last week, Andrew's hoping his tropical roulade

150
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,760
will brighten his chances of making it to the quarterfinals.

151
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,840
He's going all-out to impress.

152
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,320
Ah, you've done a joconde style?

153
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,280
Yeah. So I've got some stripes on there,

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,760
just to hint at the bit of orange that's inside.

155
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,920
It's a lovely idea.

156
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,440
Oh, that's a shame. Some of your stripes have come off.

157
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,760
That's all right.

158
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Going to give it a little bit of a cool now.

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,960
I am happy with the sponge, yeah, really happy with it.

160
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,840
- JANE:
- You just pre-roll it when it's warm so it's got some sort of memory

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
as to what shape you want it at the end.

162
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,880
I always roll it from the long end, cos you get more slices out of it.

163
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,240
SHE LAUGHS

164
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,320
You roll the short end towards you instead of the long end,

165
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't think you get enough sort of rolls in it.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,600
I am making a white chocolate roulade

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,840
with a passion fruit and raspberry cheesecake filling.

168
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
My dad absolutely loves white chocolate -

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,800
like, loves, loves white chocolate.

170
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,200
Candice's roulade will be filled with layers of raspberry cheesecake

171
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,760
and passion fruit curd.

172
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,360
For her dad, she's adding his favourite white chocolate

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,000
into her sponge, which will be covered in freeze-dried raspberries.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,280
- I just need to flick this. 
- Go on, flick it.

175
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,200
Oh!

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,480
Done with great confidence.

177
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Is it really scary doing this right in front of Mary?

178
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah, it's probably...

179
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
No. She's done it one or three times before.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,840
Look at the smile on her face, she knows it's good.

181
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,280
The sun's come out.

182
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,400
Good luck, Candice, look forward to this one.

183
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,080
- Smelling good.
- Thank you very much. 
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

184
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Honestly, petrifying but I'm so glad she said it was all right,

185
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,600
I was like, "Ohhhh!"

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,400
It's feeling flexible. I see a few cracks, but that's minor.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,640
Not hugely happy with that sponge, it's just looking a little bit flat.

188
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,600
Think I took it out of the oven just probably a minute too early.

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,400
So I'm going to go again and try to do it better. You know,

190
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,760
this is week seven of Bake Off, good enough is not good enough any more.

191
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
30 minutes to go.

192
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,920
And while Tom gambles on making a second sponge,

193
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
the other bakers start making their fillings.

194
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,840
- BENJAMINA:
- So I've just got some pineapples, bit of rum.

195
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
I want the rum to come through, because when I did it at home

196
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,120
I thought, "I can't really taste the rum, it can take a bit more,

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,680
"it can take a bit more."

198
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
So I've put quite a bit in.

199
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,880
I make roulades reasonably frequently at home.

200
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,280
There's ganache in it, there's double cream in it,

201
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,120
bit of alcohol in it.

202
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,920
Jane's roulade is one of her husband's favourites,

203
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,640
with a chocolate and hazelnut sponge filled with whipped cream

204
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,600
and a layer of boozy chocolate and hazelnut paste.

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,120
Are you getting that to a spreadable consistency?

206
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,560
- Trying to get it spreadable. 
- Which is quite tricky.

207
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
Mmm, But you can.

208
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,000
- Interesting that you've rolled it up that way.
- Yeah, lengthways.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,280
I know. I do it at home that way and I know lots of people

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,680
do it that way because you get more rolls in it,

211
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,960
- but I do it that way because you get more slices in it. 
- All right. Thank you.

212
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
Already happier with that.

213
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
The second sponge is much thicker, much lighter.

214
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,680
Its texture's way better.

215
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Now I've got to get everything else together.

216
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,280
Three of the bakers are banking on a fruit curd

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
to add a bit of sharpness to their roulades.

218
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,280
Andrew's raided his family's cookbook.

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm using my dad's recipe for passion fruit curd.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,440
Dad's made this curd for at least the past three Christmases,

221
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,800
it's a family favourite. I've shamelessly nicked it off him.

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,840
I think Candice is doing passion fruit as well,

223
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,600
but I've got confidence in Dad's curd.

224
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,200
I just put seeds of two passion fruit into the curd.

225
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,320
I think it's nice to have a little bit of seedage in there,

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,800
just not a huge amount.

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
That's got a slightly bitter aftertaste,

228
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,120
you don't want that.

229
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,400
So let's add some sugar.

230
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,920
- BEEPING 
- We're almost there with the curd.

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,480
- That's better.
- That's better. 
- Oh, it's sharp. Hm.

232
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,840
- Good.
- Yeah.

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Now it's time to get assembling.

234
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,800
The cheesecake will go on first,

235
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,320
then I will swirl through the passion fruit and then roll.

236
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,240
- MEL:
- That is a lovely, lovely, lovely sight.

237
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,640
A man spreading cream...onto a sponge.

238
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,320
- I'm slightly giddy, Selasi! 
- That's all right.

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,080
First a layer of the caramel,

240
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,760
then a layer of the crumbled up shortbread.

241
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,080
There probably is a danger of overfilling,

242
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,560
you don't want it bulging.

243
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,680
The caramel next to the sponge can be an odd texture

244
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,040
because it's two quite soft, delicate things, but personally

245
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
I think it's good and hopefully they'll like it as well.

246
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
I don't want it TOO thick.

247
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,920
I don't want it to be cream with a bit of sponge.

248
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
This is my hazelnut paste.

249
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,720
It won't spread. But what I'm going to do

250
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,880
is I'm going to add a load more to the ganache.

251
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,160
You can see this, this is not happening.

252
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,040
Bakers, just five minutes to get your roulade on.

253
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,560
Time to roll.

254
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,440
This is the tricky bit.

255
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,680
Five minutes.

256
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,200
This is always so hard.

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,200
There's too many strawberries in there.

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
I am really happy with that, actually.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,320
The moment of truth.

260
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
- SELASI:
- I'm going to cover it up anyway so...

261
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Pretty is not really on the cards right now.

262
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,880
Just got to get it looking neat.

263
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,960
- It's not messy, it's informal. 
- Informal, yeah.
- Informal.

264
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Ooh, the ooze on that.

265
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm hoping he likes the flavour and forgives me the lack of roll.

266
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Just say it's a regional thing. He won't know.

267
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,920
OK, bakers, stop. Move the roulades, roll them to the end of the benches.

268
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,960
The challenge is over.

269
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,760
Paul and Mary are looking for a roulade with a light sponge,

270
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,160
even layers of filling and the perfect swirl.

271
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,760
I love the finish, it looks really exciting.

272
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,600
Because you rolled it the opposite way, you're never going to get

273
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
a full roll, you're only going to get one and a bit. Right...

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
Well, it cuts well.

275
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,720
You managed to spread that nut mix.

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,160
- I mixed it with my ganache. 
- That's an honest girl.
- I thought so.

277
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,840
Hazelnut's sharp.

278
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,600
The alcohol in there is almost ruining the flavour,

279
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
which is a shame. The texture's beautiful.

280
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,400
I like the whole combination.

281
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,080
Perhaps it's the little bit of tipple in there that I like.

282
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
Always.

283
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,440
You've got a nice swirl in there.

284
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,680
It's very neat. I want to make sure the filling's in there

285
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,200
equally all the way down.

286
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,440
Let's just cut into it and see what it's like, shall we?

287
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,320
- MEL:
- Quite a big slice there, Paul. 
- I'll take a big slice, yeah.

288
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,920
Now, look at that, that's just perfect.

289
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,960
You haven't overbaked your sponge, it's beautifully soft.

290
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,440
Fresh pineapple, cream, and coconut.

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
The whole combination I think goes well.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,040
The essence or the extract of the coconut, does it taste natural?

293
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,800
- I'm trying to determine. 
- OK, too fake?
- I'm not sure...

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,480
- Yeah.
- OK.
- It is a pina colada though, I'll give you that.

295
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,760
And the textures are absolutely spot on.

296
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
Interesting that you covered it.

297
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,680
What's that hiding?

298
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,080
The whole thing of a roulade is to get that spiral,

299
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,440
and we're not seeing it because you've masked it.

300
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
Let's see what's happening inside.

301
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
You have got A spiral there.

302
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,320
- This was your second attempt at...? 
- Did a second sponge,

303
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,680
the first one was underbaked.

304
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,040
I would like a swirl of cream in there too,

305
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,040
because it is a bit cloying with the toffee and also the icing.

306
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
I think you've actually done a really good job on the flavours.

307
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,080
I just think the appearance is not good.

308
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,720
From my angle here, this swirl, it's very messy.

309
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,280
We've got a little crack down the side, that means that possibly

310
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,840
the sponge itself was in the oven a little bit too long,

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,480
- but we've got to taste it.
- OK.

312
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,680
Looks quite dense there.

313
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,280
Right, so I think we'll have a look and see.

314
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
The filling is a little bit soft.

315
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
Cheesecake needs to be a little bit more set.

316
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,120
It's a bit rubbery in the middle.

317
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,400
But the actual filling is absolutely scrumptious.

318
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,120
So you've got a lovely design.

319
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,520
You've got rather a soft filling, and therefore

320
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,920
instead of getting a beautiful spiral,

321
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,120
we've got it a little bit flat.

322
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,520
I like the joconde style you did with the orange on the top,

323
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,800
- that looks pretty good. Let's have a look, shall we?
- Mm.

324
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,160
Lovely flavours, they all go well together.

325
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I think the sponge is delicious. It melts in the mouth.

326
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
And the banana goes really well with it as well.

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,560
But the overall flavour is good,

328
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,520
the textures are excellent, I think you've done a pretty good job.

329
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,800
- And you've showed us one or two skills.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

330
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
Piping looks good on the top, quite neat.

331
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,280
Looks more of a fold than a swirl.

332
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,920
- It's quite a simple finish, but it's very effective.
- Right...

333
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,760
- Is it a bit unstable on the curved...?
- It's called originality.

334
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,280
It's called a photo frame, Mary. Is that a photo frame, Selasi?

335
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes, it is.

336
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
No-one's under there though.

337
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,920
I think overall you HAVE got a nice swirl -

338
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,200
you couldn't see it from the outside because it's so soft.

339
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,320
You can see it pouring out.

340
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
You've got a beautiful, soft sponge.

341
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,360
I think I could take a bit more lemon curd,

342
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,640
did you put much in there?

343
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,400
Not too much because I didn't want it oozing out, so...

344
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
The sponge is delicious. The sponge is absolutely the star of the show.

345
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
- I think you've done a really good job, actually.
- Thank you.

346
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
Selasi, come home. I'm just going to nick a strawberry.

347
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,720
That went really well, actually.

348
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,560
They liked the curd, there wasn't enough curd.

349
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,680
It's a shame I jarred the rest of it.

350
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,920
- HE LAUGHS 
- But, yeah, I'm taking this home.

351
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,240
It'll be good on toast.

352
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,680
Paul said the coconut was a bit too artificial. I can take that.

353
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,680
After last week's disaster that I had, it feels like I'm

354
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,160
back in the running now. A really great start to this week.

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,320
Didn't like the decoration so much but you know what, I think it's quite classy.

356
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,040
I wanted it to look like a chocolate bar,

357
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,000
and it did look like a chocolate bar.

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
I need to think of a way of making the Technical something that'll be

359
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,320
enjoyable and I can go into it with a bit of confidence.

360
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,040
Ohhh, happy days, bakers, it's the Technical Challenge. Yay!

361
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,000
Now, this week it's been set by Mary.

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,880
Mary, any words of advice for the lovely bakers?

363
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
You've got to be organised, you've got multi-tasking to do.

364
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
- MEL:
- Multi-tasking.

365
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,960
We will be asking you to juggle during the entire bake,

366
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,520
- if that's all right.
- Good. Mary and Paul, you must leave the tent.

367
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,000
- Bye-bye, eyes.
- Tatty-byes.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,320
- Now, bakers...
- Yes.

369
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,000
..Paul and Mary would very much like you to make...a marjolaine.

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,080
- What?
- Yes, that was my understanding too.

371
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,000
It's actually a French rectangular gateau.

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,680
You should make, please, four layers of nutty meringue

373
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,600
sandwiched with praline buttercream and ganache,

374
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,120
then the whole thing covered in nuts.

375
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
You've got three hours.

376
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,720
(Three hours.)

377
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
- On your marks...
- Get set and bake!

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,360
Marjolaine. Never, ever heard of it.

379
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,000
I think it's like a layered cake but it's meringue instead.

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,200
You've got your meringue, your cream, your meringue,

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
your cream, meringue, cream...

382
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,320
ganache, nuts. That's what I've pictured.

383
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,880
Apart from chocolate ganache, I have never made any part of it.

384
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,520
I don't really know what it should look like.

385
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,160
I can't afford to come last now. I really can't afford to come last.

386
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,600
Not at this stage of the competition, anyway.

387
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
How long have we given them for this challenge, Mary?

388
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,560
We've given them three hours.

389
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,320
- Which is pushing it a bit. 
- Wow, Mary, you really are cruel.

390
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,080
- I'm not as cruel as you usually are. 
- HE CHUCKLES

391
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,520
They've got to, first of all, make the dacquoise,

392
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,640
which is a glorified meringue with nuts.

393
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,000
Can be quite tricky to get that meringue absolutely perfect.

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,120
It's got to be crisp but not chewy,

395
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,000
because we have to cut through this gateau.

396
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
- I think we need to look into these layers.
- Indeed.

397
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
You can see the ganache and the buttercream

398
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
and the meringue as well.

399
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,680
It does look quite impressive.

400
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,120
It's very nutty.

401
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,920
You do get that texture from the dacquoise as well from the meringue.

402
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,760
It is sweet. But oh, it's so good.

403
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm at the stage where it says,

404
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,840
"Make the dacquoise, finely grind the nuts."

405
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
This is a combination of almonds and hazelnuts...

406
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,200
Grind them, and then roast them.

407
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm going to roast them for a few minutes.

408
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
You want them to be dry, golden and smelling nice and nutty.

409
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,800
Next step just says, "Make a meringue..."

410
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,040
By whisking egg whites,

411
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,120
adding in a spoonful of sugar at a time

412
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,080
to try and keep the air in.

413
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,880
It's thick, it's glossy, it's looking gorgeous.

414
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,560
My nuts are looking nice and golden brown, so now they need to cool

415
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,680
before I fold it into this,

416
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,080
and that's apparently what makes a dacquoise.

417
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
You've got to fold it in

418
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,600
and keep as much of the air in there as possible.

419
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
That's about right. It's well mixed in.

420
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,120
"Divide the meringue between three Swiss roll tins."

421
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Smooth it out, try and keep it as light as possible.

422
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,760
I considered piping it in. I want a very flat surface, I think.

423
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,160
Pictures I've seen of dacquoise before

424
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,040
are usually piped into a disc

425
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,440
so I'm going to...risk it.

426
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,760
It's not easy to spread because of the consistency of it,

427
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
so you just need to let nature do its thing.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,920
"Bake until golden." So I am going in the oven.

429
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,000
It doesn't give me a time,

430
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,160
but I reckon it's going to take at least an hour.

431
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,200
I'll try and get it ahead on my next step, chocolate ganache.

432
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Ganache is easy. It's just hot cream and chocolate.

433
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,320
So this one bit, I'm happy with.

434
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,240
From here, it may all go catastrophically downhill.

435
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,840
You just want it really glossy. I'm pretty pleased with that.

436
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
Next step is to make the praline.

437
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
It says, "Toast the blanched almonds."

438
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,920
I've never made a praline, I've never made a caramel.

439
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,960
The praline's fine, you just make a sugar syrup,

440
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,240
you get it to look nice and caramelised, shove the nuts in.

441
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,680
Just want to coat all the nuts.

442
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,560
Now we just let that set...

443
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm very happy with it.

444
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,920
Now, we all know that nuts and caramel are an exquisite,

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
delightful combination.

446
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Like Berry and Hollywood, they're a match made in heaven.

447
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,800
Actually, it was a match made in France.

448
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,480
The praline was named after

449
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,360
a 17th-century French diplomat, Count Praslin,

450
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,440
whose head chef invented the sugar and almond combination.

451
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,840
Word soon got out about this new sweet,

452
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,000
all the way to the palace of King Louis XIV.

453
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,480
And was even used by the count to curry favour with the noblemen.

454
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,440
The count decided to use praline to convince

455
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,920
the local nobility to support the French crown.

456
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,280
And according to the legend, it worked.

457
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,400
I like the idea of that. There's a lot of political tension in the UK -

458
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,840
pass round the Sherbet Dip Dabs, all's fine.

459
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,080
400 years later, in the town of Montargis,

460
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,800
the praline is still being made to the chef's original recipe

461
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,200
and sold in this shop by confectioner Benoit Digeon.

462
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Praline has been in your family for how many years?

463
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
For one century and ten years.

464
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,240
My grandfather bought the company in 1903

465
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,120
and no other praline recipe inside the books,

466
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,600
and we keep it in the family.

467
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
So, how do you make this praline?

468
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,280
It's very easy. We have to have good almonds,

469
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,480
we have to caramelise them gently and then we coat them with

470
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,200
the caramel, and after the caramel there is vanilla,

471
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
there is arabic gum, and there is sugar and that's it.

472
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,080
- That's it?
- Yeah.
- There's no secret?

473
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,440
There is no secret, there is no secret.

474
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,200
I think there's a secret.

475
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,320
How many times do they get caramelised?

476
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,480
Enough time.

477
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
- Once?
- Enough.
- Twice? Four times?

478
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,120
- Four times if you want. 
- Six times?
- Why not!

479
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,960
It doesn't really matter whether you caramelise once, twice,

480
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,800
200 times. The praline is still the count of confectionery.

481
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,480
That is nice.

482
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,600
I like that, yeah. I'm going to have that set in my door.

483
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,640
My lovely stained glass praline has now turned into this praline dust.

484
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,440
This is going to go into my buttercream.

485
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,840
Is that golden brown? I'm going to let that cool in the oven.

486
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,280
- Where's Margaux? She's in there?
- The meringues are cooling in an oven,

487
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,120
which seems like an oxymoron to me.

488
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
Is anyone else doing that? Don't pass it on.

489
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,120
- Oh, no, that's in the instructions. 
- Oh, is it? Oh, sorry!

490
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,680
Half an hour, bakers. Demi-heure.

491
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,960
Again, I'm not sure if the piping was a good idea or not,

492
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,320
but I guess we'll find out.

493
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,000
I need to be very careful...

494
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
for it not to crack.

495
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,840
It's now crumbling everywhere,

496
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,280
which I don't think is a particularly good sign.

497
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,760
Fingers crossed I haven't totally messed it up.

498
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,200
I need to bisect them to get my four sheets.

499
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,000
It's 20 centimetres wide, so that's ten on each side...

500
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,360
Ooh, I'm not going to enjoy cutting this. One bit.

501
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,160
All about precision...

502
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,120
HE GROANS

503
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Andre, comment ca va?

504
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,000
- Errrr...
- Oh, no.

505
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,960
I really think that's recoverable. Unless someone tips Mary off.

506
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,400
Many Bake Off secrets I have held close to my bosom, Andrew,

507
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,720
and this will be to the grave.

508
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,280
Yep. That's what I want to hear.

509
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,040
The spread's good thickness, spreads well, it's holding its shape...

510
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,720
Lot of concentration going on.

511
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,600
Yes, this is, this is not my forte, this sort of stuff so...

512
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
concentrating hard.

513
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,120
I think they're going to want really even layers.

514
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,160
Pop those together, no-one'll know.

515
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,800
No-one will know.

516
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,720
I think the judges are going to be looking for precision, neatness,

517
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,480
nice...even layers.

518
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,040
What do you think it looks like, having never seen one before?

519
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Kind of thinking like a Viennetta, but posher.

520
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,400
Doesn't get posher than a Viennetta, my darling.

521
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,440
It's not hummus, is it? Just tell me it's not hummus.

522
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,160
- It's not hummus. 
- It's not hummus. Good.

523
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,880
OK, cinq minutes, bakers, cinq minutes!

524
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,680
"Pipe the remaining chocolate ganache

525
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
"around the top edge of the cake."

526
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm going for a single continuous line around the edge.

527
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,200
"And pipe eight diagonal lines..."

528
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
One, two, three, four, five, six...

529
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,040
- HE GROANS 
- Messed it up.

530
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,360
Far too close together.

531
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,400
Just trying to get it filled quickly.

532
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,680
Feeling a little pressed here now.

533
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,840
OK, bakers, time is very much up now.

534
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,440
Please bring them up to the gingham altar in front of your photo.

535
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,400
Mary and Paul want to see a perfect dacquoise,

536
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,640
with four distinct layers and beautifully piped ganache.

537
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,160
Right, shall we start with this one then, Mary?

538
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,640
This one's dropped slightly, it's got a bit of a soggy bottom.

539
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
See where it's ballooned out.

540
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,160
- It's a little bit drunk-looking, isn't it?
- Mm.

541
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,320
Good piping.

542
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,720
We want that dacquoise in four layers.

543
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,120
In the very middle, we have the chocolate ganache,

544
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,960
and then we have the praline buttercream either side.

545
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,120
That has been done correctly.

546
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,800
- HE GROANS 
- That was nice and simple, Mary(!)

547
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,520
The dacquoise is a little bit chewy.

548
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Yeah. Right, number two.

549
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,040
This looks a bit neater, doesn't it?

550
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,840
It's got very good, even piping.

551
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,560
That meringue drop-through...

552
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,080
That's how it should be, and it's crisp.

553
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,760
You have the four layers...

554
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,760
The meringue is good, it's nice and crispy.

555
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,360
- Really well put together. 
- Right, let's move on.

556
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,920
This one, the piping's not too bad at all. It's OK.

557
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,360
We have all the layers.

558
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,080
When the knife went through that, it went through as it should do.

559
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,840
Little bit chewy on the meringue, the flavour's good though.

560
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,040
Mm-hm.

561
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,720
Right. Moving on.

562
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,120
Nice straight sides.

563
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,880
The piping of the ganache, although it's neat,

564
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,560
it is a little bit irregular.

565
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,080
- Knife went through very nicely there.
- It did.

566
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,880
Nice layers though.

567
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,360
Though it's crisp, there's a slight chew to it, but the chew melts.

568
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,320
Now, this one's gone a bit all over the place.

569
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,760
Decoration I don't think is as good as some of the others.

570
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,080
Just a straight line, not good enough.

571
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,040
We're not getting such distinctive layers with this one.

572
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,840
- A little on the chewy side, the dacquoise.
- Mm.

573
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,000
The last one. Now this is fairly neat...

574
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,320
- It looks well-finished. 
- Layers are there.

575
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Nice crunch in the meringue.

576
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,640
The flavours are good all the way through. Nice. And neat.

577
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,000
Mary and Paul must now decide which baker has mastered the marjolaine.

578
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,960
OK, in sixth position is this one. Whose is this?

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,400
Selasi, it was a bit of a mess on the outside.

580
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,840
The actual flavours were fantastic, but the textures were wrong.

581
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,680
And in fifth place, it's this one.

582
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,680
The piping wasn't absolutely top notch, and it's not quite straight.

583
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Fourth place...is this one.

584
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,040
Jane, the overall appearance of it was very neat,

585
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,000
but it comes down to the chewiness of that meringue.

586
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,080
And in third place...

587
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,200
The actual piping was not terribly even.

588
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,760
Number two is this one.

589
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,280
Well done.

590
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,200
The piping work was pretty neat, good height, nice straight sides.

591
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,760
And in first place...

592
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,840
THEY APPLAUD

593
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,080
Lovely flavour. Beautifully layered, good piping.

594
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,640
Altogether lovely.

595
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
Thank you.

596
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,120
- Yeah, Andrew!
- Well done.

597
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm really, really chuffed.

598
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,280
If I could continue this through to tomorrow,

599
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,240
and get Star Barker, I'd be ecstatic.

600
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,120
The moment that they tasted Andrew's and I realised how different

601
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,840
mine was to Andrew's, I knew I was going to be last,

602
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,560
or at least in the bottom few.

603
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,720
Yeah, I don't feel too great, but the standard in there is high

604
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,480
so I really can't mess up tomorrow, at all.

605
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,720
Andrew, who was so nearly shown the door last week,

606
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,000
has done really, really well so far.

607
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,360
His Signature roulade was pretty good,

608
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,120
- and in the Technical, came first. 
- He could be ready for Star Baker.

609
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,200
- Is there anybody with him? 
- Benjamina's done well.

610
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,040
I think she's in line for Star Baker.

611
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,480
It seems like there are two bakers today who are really going to

612
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,960
- have to watch themselves. 
- Tom is in trouble.

613
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,720
Fifth in Technical,

614
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
and for me really low down in Signature too.

615
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,600
I think Jane's in big trouble.

616
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,880
She messed up on the roulade to the point where I think

617
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,240
she rolled it up the wrong way.

618
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,000
I think Selasi could be in serious trouble.

619
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,560
- Candice, possibly, if she has a bad day.
- Are WE in trouble?

620
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,560
- Yes.
- We're always in trouble.
- You're always in trouble.
- OK. Good to know.

621
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,800
With a place in the quarterfinal at stake,

622
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,360
the bakers have one final challenge to impress Mary and Paul.

623
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,560
Morning, bakers. Welcome to Showstopper day.

624
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,080
Are we all feeling it? Good.

625
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,240
Paul and Mary today would love you, please,

626
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,280
to make 24 mini mousse cakes.

627
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,160
Cake equals sponge, they must have an element of sponge.

628
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,520
Mousse - they must have an element of mousse.

629
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,800
Mini - they must be small.

630
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,000
High-end and sophisticated, a little bit like Susan and myself.

631
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,680
So, we need 24 mini mousse cakes. Two flavours. 12 of each.

632
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,000
- You've got four hours. On your marks...
- Get set...
- Bake!

633
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
All right, and we're off. Good luck, everybody.

634
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm looking forward to today, actually.

635
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,240
After coming first in the Technical yesterday, it was a bit of a confidence boost.

636
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm not hugely confident about the Showstopper. Sometimes in practice

637
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,520
it's worked, other times it's been a bit of a disaster.

638
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,640
It is so hot in here.

639
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,400
What do they say? If you can't stand the heat...

640
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,160
So very hot.

641
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,720
I'm confident with this. Let's see. Let's see.

642
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,120
This challenge should show many textures.

643
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,360
It'll have a lovely soft texture from the sponge.

644
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,480
The mousse should be set and yet not too set, so it's rubbery.

645
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,400
A mousse, your spoon should hit the top, feel that tension

646
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,600
and then just drop through and it should melt in the mouth.

647
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,040
That's what a good mousse should be like. And full of flavour.

648
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,720
Each baker must make a sponge to provide the foundation

649
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,880
for their mini mousse cakes. Which type of sponge, is up to them.

650
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,960
So those are my egg yolks whisking up,

651
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,840
and that's going to be for my vanilla Genoise.

652
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,560
I think Genoise is good for a mousse cake, it's quite light.

653
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,720
So this is my chocolate sponge,

654
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,120
which is my gran's chocolate cake recipe.

655
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,280
You could say it's a bit old-fashioned,

656
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
it uses margarine and stuff,

657
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
but actually, I just think the flavour's great.

658
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm imprinting a pattern, basically,

659
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm then going to whack in the freezer.

660
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,520
And once it's solidified, I'll put a chocolate sponge over the top.

661
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,520
- Good morning, Jane.
- Good morning.

662
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,440
You've got the fleur-de-lis - now, what mixture is that?

663
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,360
That's decor paste, so it's like a cake mixture,

664
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,640
but instead of using whole eggs you use egg white.

665
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,520
And it'll be chocolate mousse, coffee mousse, vanilla mousse

666
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,760
and then some ganache.

667
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,600
Jane's first three flavours of mousse will be set in layers

668
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,480
that will be wrapped in a chocolate and vanilla joconde sponge.

669
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
If that wasn't enough mousse for one baker, she's

670
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,640
making two more for her blackcurrant and vanilla mini mousse cakes,

671
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,400
which will be topped with a fruit mirror glaze.

672
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,280
- Have you practised this? 
- Yes, I have, yeah.

673
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,360
- And it sets on time?
- Yes. 
- Lovely.
- Sounds great, Jane.

674
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,960
- Thank you, Jane.
- Well, I hope so!

675
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,680
- Yeah, good luck, see you later. 
- Thank you.

676
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,680
Yeah, it's week seven, you've got to go for it, haven't you?

677
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,640
Now going in.

678
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,960
- A minute... 
- BEEPING

679
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,880
- I am doing so much today. 
- SHE LAUGHS

680
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,520
For the bakers, time is of the essence.

681
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,360
They now need to mix their mousses.

682
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,560
The more time they spend making the mousse,

683
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
the less time they will have to set.

684
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,080
I am making an apple crumble mousse cake.

685
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,320
Benjamina's vanilla sponge will be layered with apple mousse

686
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,160
and topped with crumble and caramel shards,

687
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
and paired with a chocolate and coffee mini mousse cake.

688
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,720
Tom's doing apple. I think it's like an apple pie mousse.

689
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,000
So, similar but different.

690
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,600
I think on paper they sound pretty similar,

691
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,800
but I suspect they'll come out very different.

692
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,200
Not necessarily to my favour, I imagine.

693
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,800
This is fresh raspberries for my raspberry mousse.

694
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,320
Selasi's raspberry mousse cake

695
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,840
will be topped with a passion fruit jelly.

696
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,760
He's also making a chocolate mousse,

697
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,480
layered with a white chocolate and mint ganache.

698
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,520
Timing wise, it's all about setting that mousse.

699
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm going to use the freezer for about half an hour just to sort of

700
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,320
speed it up, and then the rest of it will be in the fridge.

701
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,920
I think you're very wise to use the freezer,

702
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,840
because...warm day, and you're using it as an extra chill.

703
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,280
Four sheets of gelatine...

704
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,600
Chilling is not the only way to set their mousses.

705
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,760
The addition of gelatine helps the mousse set quicker.

706
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,320
This is gelatine, leaf gelatine.

707
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
So I'm using a fair amount.

708
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,760
It's sort of double what I did at home.

709
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,280
Getting the right amount of gelatine is crucial.

710
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,240
Too much and it'll be rubbery -

711
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,200
too little, and it'll result in a sloppy, unset mess.

712
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,840
So I've got about four sheets of gelatine in here,

713
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,720
and that will give it a nice, firm set.

714
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,520
This is cream with gelatine going into the white chocolate.

715
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
I wanted to go for classic flavours,

716
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
but just done in a slightly different way.

717
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
It's going to be like little finger sandwiches,

718
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,320
nice picnic bench and it's a hipster's picnic.

719
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,280
So, you know, taking something really classic and simple and

720
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,760
making it ludicrously complicated, which is the hipster way.

721
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,560
Tom's attempting two different flavoured sponges

722
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,000
for the "bread" of his sandwiches.

723
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,240
Carrot for his carrot cake mousse sandwich, and an apple sponge

724
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,080
for his white chocolate mousse sandwich.

725
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,400
Are you using moulds?

726
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,880
No. I'm going to pipe my mousses.

727
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
- You're piping all this on? 
- I'm piping the mousse on.

728
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,080
I think you're going to struggle piping mousse with those layers,

729
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,680
and chilling them and getting them ready in time.

730
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,440
I think so too.

731
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
Right. OK.

732
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,880
- Good luck, Tom.
- Thank you.

733
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,280
I did have moulds and I thought, "Piping will make it easier."

734
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,840
Didn't think it through.

735
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,360
- MEL:
- Mousse gets its unique light texture

736
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,080
from the addition of whisked egg whites.

737
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,080
You're folding in the egg whites - you don't want to knock any

738
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,600
of the air out, you know, mousse has got to have air holes in it.

739
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,560
So you've got to be fairly delicate with it.

740
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,200
Both Candice and Jane are going a step further

741
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,960
to get the maximum volume into their mousses.

742
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,200
It's Italian meringue,

743
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,520
and it gets folded into the mousses

744
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,000
to make it...mousse-like.

745
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,280
Just want to whisk it up so it's nice and thick and shiny...

746
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,160
- Hello, Candice. 
- Good morning.
- Hey, Candice.

747
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,400
- Hi.
- Can you tell us about your two mini mousse cakes?

748
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,120
My champagne cocktail is a prosecco and raspberry liqueur jelly.

749
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,840
And on top of that will be my mini mousse

750
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,400
which will have a lemon and lemon thyme sponge.

751
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,720
I have then got a blackberry and raspberry mousse,

752
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,880
and on top of that will be a raspberry liqueur...jelly.

753
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,360
- That's just one of them. 
- That's one of them.
- That's one.

754
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,320
Candice's love of vintage has inspired her Kir Royal

755
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,560
blackberry and raspberry mousse cake, served in a champagne saucer.

756
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,200
To complement it, she's also making

757
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,360
an after-dinner mint chocolate mousse

758
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,160
that will conceal a heart-shaped chocolate sponge.

759
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,720
- You're saying you've got this hidden sponge?
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

760
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,120
Now, how... Is that a mousse base and you've got the sponge...?

761
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,280
The sponge and then mousse round, so the sponge will be in the middle.

762
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,400
- You've taken on a lot, haven't you?
- I always do.

763
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,040
Mary and Paul said I've given myself a lot to do,

764
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,280
so, there's nothing new there.

765
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,120
Candice isn't alone with the biggest workload.

766
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,800
Jane is on mousse three of five.

767
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,320
This is vanilla mousse, then I've just got to do

768
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,440
a blackcurrant one, a chocolate one and a coffee one.

769
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Quite an ambitious task to do so many mousses!

770
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
They look done.

771
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,520
Don't want to put mousse on warm cake.

772
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,200
The mousse operation is the tense bit. The piping is just a nightmare.

773
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,080
Come off, come off, come off. It's pretty good.

774
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,200
I was just thinking it wasn't going to work.

775
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,840
I was having nightmares about this.

776
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,040
My chocolate sponges are really good, nice and fluffy.

777
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,440
I am measuring my strawberries. If I don't do it,

778
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,080
then the mousse won't cover them and the jelly will leak down the side.

779
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,040
Andrew, mini mousses, tell us all about it.

780
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,880
My mini mousse is going to be forest fruit mousse

781
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,200
on a vanilla sponge base.

782
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
And the other one is going to be a mint chocolate mousse,

783
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
and I'm going to make some honeycomb.

784
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,480
Andrew's using his family's love of ice cream

785
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,280
to capture a day at the seaside in mousse form.

786
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,680
His mint chocolate and forest fruit mini cakes will climb on board

787
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,520
a home-made mini Ferris wheel, just for cakes!

788
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,320
My friend James helped make

789
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
the little hangers for the Ferris wheel.

790
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,360
- It's all quite ambitious. 
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

791
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,800
- Good luck, Andrew. 
- Cheers, thanks very much.

792
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,680
I'm working pretty quick, but I have got a lot of elements later on,

793
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,640
so I just need to get chilling ASAP.

794
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,240
My mousse is nice and light, it is smooth.

795
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm going to blast it in the freezer for about half an hour.

796
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Looks all right. Let's just hope it sets.

797
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,920
One down.

798
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,040
Two hours remaining.

799
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm getting started on my chocolate mousse.

800
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,200
Chocolate and coffee always work well.

801
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
Hopefully, it'll be a winner.

802
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,400
There seems to be a lot of mint chocolate in the tent today.

803
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,280
I think Andrew is doing chocolate mint actually,

804
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
but it'll be interesting to see who gets the flavour right.

805
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,840
It has just set a little bit too much.

806
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,000
So I am actually going to make my blackberry/raspberry mousse again.

807
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,600
I have a horrible feeling I have left gelatine out of something.

808
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,320
They've just got to go in the freezer.

809
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,640
Whatever they come out like, they come out like.

810
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,600
I definitely put gelatine in that.

811
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,240
Definitely put gelatine in my blackcurrant...

812
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,440
They have just got to go in now.

813
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,200
I like to think the gelatine is in there,

814
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,600
I keep trying to persuade myself it really has set.

815
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,120
SHE CHUCKLES

816
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,440
As the other bakers rely on moulds

817
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,400
to set and shape their mousses...

818
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,960
..Tom is busy filling his sandwiches.

819
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,320
I'm slightly working up my nerve for it.

820
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,720
This is the bit where it has all gone wrong.

821
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,000
This is make or break, this stage.

822
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,120
Version two is looking a lot better.

823
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm going to pour my mousse mix straight on top

824
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,280
of my sponge mix. Straight into the freezer.

825
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,680
- How you doing?
- Tight for time.
- OK.

826
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,440
I feel like we've been in a chocolate abattoir, Jane, slightly.

827
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,880
You look great, you're rocking it, by the way, you are rocking.

828
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,280
My mousse is out - get the decoration on,

829
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,560
and the un-moulding is going to be the scary bit,

830
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,640
cos that's the bit where we'll find out if it's set or not.

831
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,240
These are set a bit. Needs to be in the fridge longer.

832
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,400
It's definitely set, that is for sure,

833
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
so it's not going to collapse.

834
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,080
It's just trying to get it out.

835
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,880
- SIGHING:
- Thank the Lord.

836
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,360
I'm having to work really quickly because I know that I need to

837
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,960
do chocolate ones, and I just don't know

838
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,280
what THEY are going to come out like.

839
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,600
I feel like I am back on target.

840
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,560
My chocolate one is now in, this is good news.

841
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,400
- You all right? Breathe, breathe. 
- (It's not going very well.)

842
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,800
It looks lovely, just breathe, breathe.

843
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,520
30 minutes left, bakers, 30 minutes.

844
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,920
This is better than being at the gym,

845
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,760
I have done more running today than I have done in months.

846
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,040
If I could swear, I think I probably would. As in, "Thank beep."

847
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,680
They look so bad. Hopefully we can cover them in glaze.

848
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,640
That's not really set.

849
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,680
Which is really bad.

850
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,040
Looks like we're just about OK.

851
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
That's not good at all.

852
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,000
The mousse is just not...

853
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,880
It's sagged a bit, it's just not where it needs to be.

854
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't think Mary and Paul are going to be very impressed actually.

855
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,960
Disaster.

856
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,360
Keep your fingers crossed.

857
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,080
It is just melting like... I don't even know what.

858
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,120
They're going to collapse. They will collapse.

859
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,720
They are just sliding everywhere.

860
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,120
- JANE:
- That one's going. It's-a going.

861
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,880
Bakers, that's five minutes to go

862
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,440
till your mini mousse need to be served.

863
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,880
I'm looking for more wobble than me on a truss-free Sunday.

864
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,480
The countdown begins.

865
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,840
Five minutes. HE SIGHS

866
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,520
- ANDREW:
- I'm rushing this, and this is not a job for rushing.

867
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,680
- Oops.
- Oh, no!

868
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,000
Will you ever write a big dipper again after this, Andrew?

869
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,760
- Probably not.
- OK. Good man.

870
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,600
So are you going to quarter those mousse

871
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,880
to make the mini, mini mousse, or...?

872
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,400
- I suppose for you that IS a mini mousse.
- That's a mini mousse.

873
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,080
HE LAUGHS For me, that's an entire cake.

874
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,680
Oh, my God, they're just melting...

875
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,600
Right, bakers, that is literally it with the mini mousse cakes.

876
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,880
Step away from the Millennium Wheel of lard.

877
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,320
HE EXHALES

878
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,560
Mary and Paul are looking for 24 mini mousse cakes,

879
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,960
perfectly presented and with a fully aerated mousse.

880
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,120
Five mousses,

881
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,560
and you've achieved great things.

882
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,040
That fleur-de-lis is outstanding, it looks great.

883
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,480
These, in their own way, are quite startling.

884
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,880
- I hope they're going to taste really good.
- I hope so.

885
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,160
Just look how that cut. Beautifully set.

886
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,680
That's mousse.

887
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,960
You feel the bubbles bursting in your mouth.

888
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,440
Delicious. Yeah, really well done.

889
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,680
It's a shame they look like they do.

890
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,000
That's purely down to the jelly on the top not setting.

891
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,120
You have achieved a light mousse. It's aerated.

892
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,400
Thank you very much.

893
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,440
Now, let's move on. These are the coffee ones?

894
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,560
They're chocolate on the bottom, then coffee,

895
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,720
and then a vanilla on the top.

896
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,960
Holding well.

897
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,080
It has got a nice mousse-iness to it, a nice bit of aeration.

898
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,520
Let's taste.

899
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,880
Beautiful cappuccino.

900
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,840
It's mousse-like, it's light, all the flavours are coming through,

901
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,120
from the vanilla to the chocolate to the coffee.

902
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,880
The sponge is delicious too. I think you've done really well.

903
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,000
Thank you.

904
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,200
These look very attractive.

905
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,880
The mousse, from the side,

906
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,640
looks beautifully light.

907
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,240
I can see little bubbles all the way.

908
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,880
I love these, love the passion fruit,

909
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,920
I think they look very delicate, very good.

910
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,840
These guys here, though, are just too big.

911
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,320
- You forgot the word "mini".
- Yeah.

912
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,720
- What is that green again? 
- White chocolate and mint.

913
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,040
The actual chocolate mousse at the bottom is not very aerated.

914
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,640
I would have put the sponge, then the mint,

915
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,920
- and then the mousse sitting on the top.
- OK.

916
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,800
Because as you push through the chocolate on the top,

917
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,360
your mousse just flies out. Because it's so solid.

918
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,320
Moving on to the passion fruit...

919
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,880
That combination is lovely. The mousse is light, it's aerated.

920
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,160
The sponge, not too thick a layer. A lovely sponge.

921
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,120
Flavour of the mousse,

922
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,840
texture of the mousse is very good,

923
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,840
- and overall, it's a lovely flavour. 
- Thank you.

924
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,440
I think we need to get stuck into this one first, have a look,

925
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,880
before it starts to melt.

926
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,880
It's more a cream than a mousse.

927
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,600
You've made it very difficult for yourself not giving it

928
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
- the support of sponge.
- Yeah.

929
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,480
I think the flavours are good,

930
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,320
the textures on the chocolate are good.

931
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,040
- It is more like a ganache than a mousse.
- Yeah. Sorry.

932
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,640
Now, this looks SO pretty,

933
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,480
and I can think that that would be a lovely thing to eat.

934
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,880
- I could do, actually, with a stronger fruit flavour.
- OK.

935
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,160
You certainly have got a little bit of aeration in the mousse.

936
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,360
You haven't mixed it thoroughly, and you've got some cream in blobs.

937
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,480
The flavour's good,

938
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,040
- I just think the texture of that mousse is too stiff for me.
- OK.

939
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,480
They're a little bit messy.

940
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,800
The top do look like cappuccino, if I'm honest,

941
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,600
but it's pouring all over the top.

942
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,480
They just did not set in the freezer.

943
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
As soon as I took the acetate off, they just went, "Wuh."

944
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,680
Right.

945
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,320
Oh, wow. They taste amazing.

946
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,760
SUE LAUGHS

947
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,440
At least they taste good!

948
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
Oh, I think I'm going in for another bit,

949
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,520
- I really don't care.
- I don't. It's waking me up, this one.

950
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,400
The sponge itself is beautifully soft,

951
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,240
the cream is a beautiful sort of cappuccino...

952
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,000
- Yeah, it's a shame it's not neat.
- I know.
- Let's look at the apple ones.

953
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,680
Although... That's nice as well. It's sharp.

954
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,240
The apple coming through is delicious. It's very, very good.

955
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
And it is more mousse-like actually.

956
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,680
- Than the first one.
- It is beautiful! It doesn't look awfully good...

957
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,160
- I know!
- ..but it's lovely.

958
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,640
- Well done, Benjamina.
- Thank you.

959
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,880
Well, it's a very original idea,

960
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,480
but there isn't much finesse about it.

961
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,520
You have managed to pipe them,

962
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,000
but I can't imagine how you've been able to

963
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,680
keep the lightness when piping a mousse.

964
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,000
Right. Let's start with the apple one.

965
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,600
- The apple pie with the melted ice cream...?
- Yeah.

966
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,120
If this was a challenge for a mini cake with a picnic theme,

967
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,160
you'd be top of the class.

968
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,640
And I do get the idea of the apple pie

969
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,280
with the melted ice cream, by the way.

970
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,600
But the mixture that you piped is not a mousse, it's quite heavy.

971
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,640
Now, this is the carrot cake, isn't it?

972
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,920
When you pipe a mixture in the centre,

973
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,640
it hasn't filled the actual sandwich.

974
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,160
There are great gaps in it.

975
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,320
- It reminds me more of a spice cake than a carrot cake.
- Mm.

976
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,640
Nutmeg. Gone a bit overboard I think with the nutmeg.

977
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,840
OK.

978
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,160
And it's not mousse again, it's quite stodgy, it's thick.

979
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,000
I think your idea's fantastic - on another challenge. Thanks, Tom.

980
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,040
They look gorgeous.

981
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,480
The whole effect is absolutely stunning.

982
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,800
We'll start on one of the fruits of the forest.

983
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,840
Cuts well.

984
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,720
- That tastes delicious. 
- Tastes divine. It really does.

985
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,840
The sponge is baked perfectly, the flavour is gorgeous

986
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,760
and the jelly is perfectly set, and it holds itself really well.

987
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,960
And you've shown us you can do chocolate curls.

988
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,240
Now, this one's got the honeycomb on the top, hasn't it?

989
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,600
It is very soft, this mousse.

990
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,560
It's a good sponge...

991
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,880
Sponge is delicious, got lots of flavour.

992
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,520
Mm.

993
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,040
- The mint mousse is fantastic. 
- Thank you very much.

994
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,560
BIRDSONG

995
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,760
This is quite an impressive array of baked goods, don't you think?

996
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,240
- MARY:
- They've got style, we've had some excellent flavours,

997
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,640
I think it was a very good challenge.

998
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,000
Jane was looking a bit wobbly when she went into today -

999
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,600
has she managed to save herself?

1000
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,880
I would say she definitely has.

1001
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,520
Who else would tackle five mousses? And wonderful flavours.

1002
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,320
- And it was a mousse, proper mousse. 
- Is she safe, Paul?

1003
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
- Yeah, I think she is. 
- Selasi was in trouble.

1004
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,800
He delivered some Scooby Snacks as his mini mousse.

1005
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,480
The chocolate mousse is delicious,

1006
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,120
but you can't do something like that as a Showstopper.

1007
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,880
Tom was also in trouble, and he delivered his Hipster's Picnic,

1008
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,880
so what did you think of that?

1009
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,160
The filling was not a mousse, and it was rather clumsily piped.

1010
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,160
The idea was fantastic, but we wanted a mousse,

1011
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,560
- and I don't think we got a mousse. 
- Moving on to Benjamina...

1012
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,120
If you shut your eyes and ate both of those,

1013
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,960
- you'd give them first prize all round.
- Yeah.

1014
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,080
She got the flavours absolutely spot-on,

1015
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,640
but they didn't look so good.

1016
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,320
She was in a high position going into Showstopper day though.

1017
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,200
I wouldn't discount the fact that she could win Star Baker,

1018
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,720
because it did taste very, very good.

1019
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,640
So moving on to Candice - again, very nice idea,

1020
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,680
but almost her downfall to suspend

1021
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,320
those beautiful mini mousses in jelly.

1022
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,840
She's got to be really careful. She's a good, natural baker,

1023
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,280
but I think sometimes she concentrates on the stuff

1024
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,400
on the outside rather than the actual core bake we're looking for.

1025
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,480
That leaves Andrew.

1026
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,840
If there was one display that drew our eyes, it was Andrew's.

1027
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,600
Very original, beautifully produced.

1028
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,720
All the way through he's showed us several skills,

1029
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,640
and he has a very good finish.

1030
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,200
And do you think you know possibly

1031
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,480
who might not be joining us next time?

1032
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,960
- We've already spoken, and actually we've both decided that, yes, we know who it is.
- Yep.

1033
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,640
Bakers, I get the brilliant job,

1034
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,760
because I get to say who is Star Baker.

1035
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Now, it's fair to say that this person has had

1036
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,560
their fair share of ups and downs over the course of this competition.

1037
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,000
One might say, if one was feeling cliched,

1038
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,040
it's been a bit of a roller coaster.

1039
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,240
He's cleverer than that -

1040
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,400
he'd probably do it as a Ferris wheel decked with mini mousse.

1041
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,000
For the very first time - congratulations, Andrew,

1042
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,920
- you're Star Baker. 
- Thank you.
- Aww...

1043
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,840
Don't start crying.

1044
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,920
This bit of the weekend gets harder and harder,

1045
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,560
and it's up to me to announce the person

1046
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,920
who very, very sadly will not be coming with us into next week.

1047
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,240
And that person is...

1048
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,480
..Tom. We're really sad to say goodbye.

1049
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,640
It's all right, I knew that was happening.

1050
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,400
- You've done so well, mate. 
- Yeah, it's good.

1051
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,040
'I think right until the moment your name's called,'

1052
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,200
you kind of think, "Oh, maybe it's someone else."

1053
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,800
But I knew it was going to happen, I knew that was going to be my name.

1054
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,360
I would've loved to be in the tent right through to the end,

1055
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,240
but someone has to go each week, and it had to be me this week.

1056
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,000
There was nobody else it could have been.

1057
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,240
To get through to this stage in The Great British Bake Off

1058
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,320
he should feel very proud of himself.

1059
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,840
- You've done brilliantly, Tom.
- What a week to go out on, you know?

1060
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,560
This is the first time in Bake Off history,

1061
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,240
we've have lost the winner of Bread Week.

1062
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,160
They normally reach the final, so

1063
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,520
I do feel sorry for him, he IS a great baker.

1064
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,880
'That was a very close escape, very close escape,

1065
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,000
'it doesn't mean I'm still safe.'

1066
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,440
But I'm in the quarterfinal, I don't know how!

1067
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,320
Quarterfinals! Yes!

1068
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,200
I'm actually really, really proud,

1069
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,680
especially after the Showstopper that looked...quite a hot mess.

1070
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,280
I was a bit nervous. But I'm glad that I'm through.

1071
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,360
Yes! Finally, finally, finally.

1072
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,320
I'm delighted. I'm really, really super chuffed. Super, super chuffed.

1073
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,760
'I've got a chance to make the final.'

1074
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,360
But I suppose now I'm going to have to step it up a gear again.

1075
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,760
- 'Next time...' 
- Coming out, coming out, coming out.

1076
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,880
'..it's the quarterfinal.

1077
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,200
'And for the first time in the history of Bake Off...'

1078
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,560
Get set, my lords and ladies.

1079
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,840
'..it's Tudor Week.'

1080
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,200
If we did study the Tudors at school,

1081
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't remember much about them!

1082
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,520
'With marzipan centrepieces...'

1083
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,720
Real Showstopper, that is.

1084
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,680
'..a Technical that's got everyone in knots...'

1085
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,680
Oh, dear. This looks a mess.

1086
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,560
'..and pies fit for a king!

1087
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,440
'Or...Paul.'
