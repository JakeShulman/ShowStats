1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,799
Three weeks in, 12 bakers down to ten.
They're on a roll. As are we.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,799
And I'm wearing LOAFers.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,799
BOTH: Welcome to The
Great British Bake Off.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,799
Last time...

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
I've messed up massively.

6
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:14,799
..gingerbread went up
and came tumbling down.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,799
VAL GASPS For Louise...

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,799
I can't believe this is happening to me...
it spelt the end.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,799
But Candice's spectacular pub stood firm...

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,799
I think it's smashing, well done.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,799
..and the Star Baker crown was hers.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,799
Now they face the wrath of Paul.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,799
I've been worrying all night about it.
It's like wallpaper paste.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,799
It's Bread Week... I'm not going to eat it.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,799
..with a sweet signature
that could turn sour...

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,799
I think it's cooked. If
Paul says it isn't...

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,799
Answer to me... with a technical
bake without an oven...

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
This is just so weird.

19
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,799
..and giant, plaited Showstoppers...

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
This is the serpent...

21
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,799
..with nowhere to hide. Do you
want a little sip of this,

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,799
Michael, before I tell you what I think?

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,799
But who will be our next Star Baker?
I have no idea what I'm looking for.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
And whose Bread Week...

25
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,799
You are not alone... will be their last?

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
CANDICE: Oh, no.

27
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm just a bit... BENJAMINA SQUEALS

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,799
I'm feeling amazing about Star
Baker, but new week this week,

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,799
slate gets wiped clean.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,799
I'm quite nervous, cos it's
bread and it's Paul Hollywood.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,799
He's going to be really, really picky.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,799
At home I've been prodding
my bread in the centre,

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,799
cos I know that Paul's going to do that.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,799
I tend to do basic bread,
rather than faffed-about bread,

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
so I'm more of a bloomers and baps girl.

36
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,799
It's something I've been doing for years,

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
so Bread Week is just another week.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,799
Bakers, it's Bread Week.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,799
This is your chance to get
your dough prodded by

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,799
Paul Hollywood's digits of doom.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Now, for your Signature Challenge,

42
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,799
we would love you to
make a chocolate bread.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,799
The bread must contain
chocolate in any form -

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,799
cocoa powder, molten
chocolate, chocolate chips,

45
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,799
the choice is entirely yours.

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,799
Shape and design it in any way you see fit.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,799
You have two and a half hours, bakers,

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
for this Signature Challenge.

49
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,800
On your marks. Get set. BOTH: Bake.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,799
I'm very excited about this
chocolate bread challenge.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,799
We've never had one before.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,799
I'm looking for a bread texture
with the flavour of chocolate.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,799
Considering they've only
got two and a half hours,

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,799
that is going to be a tall order.

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,799
The last thing I want to see on
this challenge is raw dough.

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,799
All of the bakers have chosen to
make an enriched dough as the base

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,799
for their chocolate bread by
adding ingredients like milk,

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,799
butter, sugar and eggs.

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,799
The richer your dough, the more
you have in, the slower it is

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,799
and it takes a long while for the
yeast to react with the flour.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,799
Candice. Good morning. Morning.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,799
Where are you up to with
your chocolate bread?

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,799
This is my brioche dough with
a little bit of cinnamon

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,799
and a little bit of brown sugar
and some Normandy butter.

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,799
Candice's brioche bread will be
formed from dozens of dough balls,

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,799
filled with salted caramel and chocolate,

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,799
topped with shards of pecan brittle.

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,799
How much butter have you got in there?
250. Ohh. Really?!

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,799
That's almost as enriched as I am.

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,799
How many eggs have you got in there? Four.

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,799
Are you trying to frighten her?
Yeah, he really, really is.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,799
I've done it at home and it's been
good and people have liked it.

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,799
In two and a half hours? Mm-hm.
Good luck. Thank you.

74
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I admire that philosophy.

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,799
Bread needs a lot of muscle, so
you've really got to get in there.

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,799
Got to get in there.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,799
Kneading the dough helps
develop the gluten,

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,799
creating a good structure for the bread.

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,799
I do 500 kneads.

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,799
Hi, guys. Morning. Can you tell
us about your chocolate bread?

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,799
Yeah. I'm making a chocolate,
cardamom and hazelnut loaf.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,799
Is that all the dough? This
is all the dough, yeah.

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
It's a pretty small loaf. It is small,

85
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,799
but I'm hoping for a good rise on it.

86
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,799
Rav's chocolate, cardamom
and hazelnut bread will be

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,799
twisted into a spiral and
then baked in a loaf tin.

88
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,799
It's going to be like a babka. Oh, babka.
I know what a babka...

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,799
What's a babka? It's a twisty bread.

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,799
Middle Eastern, what is it? I think
it's Middle Eastern. Is it, Paul?

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,799
It's Polish and it's normally a cake.

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,799
So in no ways is this a babka. Good luck.

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Happy babka-ing, wherever
it may take you. Thanks.

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,799
Rav won't be alone on his travels.

95
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,799
I'm making a chocolate,
tahini and almond babka.

96
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
And are you spiralling it through

97
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,799
or is it flavouring the whole mixture?

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,799
I'm going to roll this out, spread
the paste on top, roll it up,

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,799
slice it, twist it, stick it in the tin.

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,799
That's a couronne.

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,799
No, it's a babka. It's a couronne.

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,799
What's your problem with this,
you think it's a couronne?

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,799
What you do with a couronne,
you twist it and then join it.

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,799
All they're doing is putting it in a tin

105
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,799
by folding it up and putting it in there.

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Yes, but don't be grumpy about it.

107
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,799
It's Benjamina's own... It'll taste good.
Exactly. Yeah.

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,799
Usually they take a lot longer to bake...

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,799
Than two and a half hours.
This is an express babka.

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,799
Benjamina will be using dark
chocolate and toasting her

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,799
almonds for the filling
of her express babka.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,799
Paul says it wasn't a
babka, but I disagree.

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,799
Paul's not in the best of
moods, he's a bread guy,

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,799
so obviously he's going
to be a bit picky, but...

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,799
BENJAMINA LAUGHS

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,799
The bread that I'm making
is called a cobbled loaf,

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,799
named after my husband's grandmother
who I was very close to,

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,799
her name was Nanny Cobbled and
it looks like cobblestone.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,799
Kate's the only baker making two
doughs - cardamom and orange,

120
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,799
chocolate and vanilla - and each

121
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,799
cobble will contain a chunk
of dark or white chocolate.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,799
This loaf's meant to keep everybody in my
house happy, cos some people like dark

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,799
chocolate, some people like white chocolate,
some people like chocolate dough, some

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
people like white dough, so
it's a bread for everybody.

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,799
I'm just doing something
called the windowpane test,

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,799
so I just want to see if
enough gluten's been formed

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,799
to stretch out the dough to
be able to see through it

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,799
without it breaking, which
is the point at which I know

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,799
it's ready to prove.
Looks like we're there.

130
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,799
I want to get two proves in,

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,799
cos I like the texture of the bread better,

132
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
it gets smaller bubbles.

133
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,799
It should be about an hour
for the first proving.

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,799
The second one depends on
how long I've got left.

135
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,799
I've just got it in the
oven at about 35 degrees.

136
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,799
It's going to be in there for 25 minutes,

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,799
cos it wants to chill out and do its thing.

138
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,799
It's starting to move. Today I'm
making a chocolate barmbrack.

139
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,799
Barmbrack is a traditional
Irish Halloween loaf.

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,799
Andrew's substituting the
Barmbrack's customary raisins

141
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,799
for milk chocolate chips.

142
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,799
He's the only baker adding
all his ingredients

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,799
before proving his dough.

144
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,799
I'm just doing a single prove.
A single prove?!

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,799
Does it end up looking like that? Yeah.

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,799
Yeah, it's because its got no
strength, it's trying to grow,

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,799
the knocking back is quite
an important process.

148
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,799
My justification is it's come from
the traditional recipe, but...

149
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,799
That old chestnut. Good luck.
Thank you. Cheers, thanks.

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,799
I'm not double proving, I'm not
knocking it back. Are you not? OK.

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,799
Which is unconventional.

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
How long have we got left?

153
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:01,799
We've got three, an hour and a half.
An hour and a half, that's fine.

154
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
It's chill time, relax a little bit.

155
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
As they wait for their dough to prove,

156
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,799
the bakers make a start on their fillings.

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,799
As a child, chocolate was a rarity,
so I'm trying to make up for it now.

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,799
To indulge her sweet tooth, Val's
using chocolate spread as well

159
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,799
as dark chocolate chips to fill her
twisted cinnamon and vanilla loaf.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,799
It's very rich chocolate, you don't
need to buy bought chocolate

161
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,799
spread, you can make your own.

162
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,799
My loaf's called Tom's chocolate
orange swirl bread, but I'm not

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,799
going for huge amounts of chocolate
and the chocolate I am using is

164
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
very, very dark.

165
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:40,799
Tom's Aztec-inspired bread will have
a spicy swirl of dark chocolate,

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,799
ginger, cinnamon and bird's eye
chilli running through it.

167
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,799
There's your chilli. Are
you finely chopping it?

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,799
Yes, with the seeds and
the white taken out.

169
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,799
Wow, OK, that's going to be fascinating.

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,799
You're great with your
flavours a lot of the time.

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
But when you fail, you
catastrophically fail.

172
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,799
My dough has had its first prove.

173
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,799
I'm just knocking the air out of the dough.

174
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,799
Oh, yeah, see, he's happy.
(Oh, this has not risen.)

175
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,799
Good dough, well done.

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,799
No, it hasn't risen as much
as I would like it to.

177
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,799
I'm hoping I'll get the
height on the second rise.

178
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,799
OK, bakers, one hour until the silverback
of sourdough is unleashed from his pen.

179
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,799
BENJAMINA FAKES CRYING

180
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,799
First prove is done, which
I'm quite happy with.

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,799
Just going to roll it out
now and spread the butter

182
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,799
and the chocolate on it then get
it back in for a second prove.

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm looking at everyone else and
I see how much dough they have.

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,799
I think that I don't have a lot,
but this is how it was at home,

185
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,799
so I'll just stick to my guns.

186
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,799
Right, Michael. Can you tell us what
you're up to and what you're making?

187
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,799
I'm making a chilli chocolate and
chia seed bread with cinnamon.

188
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,799
Sort of Mexican inspired. That's
quite an intense flavour. Yes.

189
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,799
So that paste is going to go
on top of that butter. Yeah.

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,799
Then I'm going to roll
it up, cut it in half,

191
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,799
twist it and make it into a couronne.

192
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Michael is also adding

193
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,799
cayenne pepper to bring even more

194
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,799
heat to his bread, which he'll ice

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
with a dark chocolate ganache.

196
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,799
You're making a right pig's ear of that.

197
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,799
It wasn't like this when I did it at home.

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,799
This is one of the most manually
explored breads I've ever seen.

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I know, I know.

200
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:12,799
I'm making chocolate,
cinnamon orange bread.

201
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,799
I'm using dark chocolate so, obviously,

202
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
when you bake dark chocolate it

203
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,799
goes a bit bitter so the orange
gives a bit of a sweet taste.

204
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,799
Selasi's bread will be cut to
expose the dark chocolate cinnamon

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,799
and orange zest filling, then
glazed with an orange syrup.

206
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,799
You don't want too much
chocolate because as it melts,

207
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,799
it seeps out, so just enough.

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,799
I'm a bit of a rogue baker,

209
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,799
I don't usually stick to recipes.

210
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,799
It looks about right to me.

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Hello, Jane. Good morning.

212
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,799
Tell us about that mixture.
How did you make it?

213
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,799
Chocolate mixture is melted butter,

214
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,799
dark chocolate with icing sugar and cocoa.

215
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,799
It looks like chocolate spread.
I want that.

216
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,799
Jane's adding almond liqueur,
poached cranberries and

217
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,799
pecans to her crown-shaped loaf.

218
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,799
Is it helping that we're all watching you?

219
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,799
Never has a couronne been more
monitored on this planet.

220
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,799
Once filled, the dough must
be shaped before proving for

221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
a second time.

222
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,799
Most of the bakers are choosing
to roll and then cut...

223
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,799
I find in practice this works
at home, so... disaster.

224
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,799
..and then twist their dough.
A lot of twisters...

225
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,799
Jane. Hmm. Have you seen the film Alien?

226
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,799
There's a hint of sort of
John Hurt's exploded stomach

227
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,799
to that, isn't there? JANE LAUGHS

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,799
It is exploding a bit.
King Kong behind you,

229
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,799
let's see what he makes of it.
What do you reckon?

230
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,799
I mean, that's bursting in flavour.
There's too much filling.

231
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,799
Oh, God, don't listen. I got one of
those looks, didn't I? Oh, well.

232
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,799
But Candice and Kate aren't twisting.

233
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,799
All these balls will prove and join
together and make one nice loaf.

234
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,799
I'm going to do a third of them
with chocolate and caramel,

235
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,799
a third with just caramel and
a third with just chocolate.

236
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,799
Just make sure they're amply
filled, cos no-one likes a small,

237
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
under-filled ball.

238
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,799
While the other bakers shape their dough,

239
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,799
Andrew's waiting for his bread to
complete its one and only prove.

240
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,799
There are some quite
exotic things going on.

241
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,799
I think mine is potentially
the simplest - hopefully it

242
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,799
makes up for that in taste.

243
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,799
By proving for a second time, the
bakers are giving the yeast another

244
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,799
chance to grow, which should
result in a better-textured loaf.

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,799
Leave it ten, 15 minutes
for the second prove.

246
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,799
Haven't got a huge amount
of time, but that's OK.

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
We'll hope for the best.

248
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,799
50 minutes to go and Andrew has
already decided to stop proving.

249
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,799
Quite flat, but I think that's
OK, I'm very tight on time,

250
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,799
so I just need to get it in the oven.

251
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,799
For the rest of the bakers, the
longer they continue to prove,

252
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,799
the less time they'll have to bake.

253
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,799
How's yours going? Not good,
I'm running out of time.

254
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I need that rise, man.

255
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,799
See, I'm going for better to
have something under-proved and

256
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,799
baked than serve him something raw.

257
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,799
I fudged my timings hard,
I don't understand.

258
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,799
Another four minutes and
it's got to go in the oven.

259
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,799
BENJAMINA SIGHS

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,799
These are not as proved as
I would like them to be,

261
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,799
but I haven't got time to wait any longer.

262
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
It's more important that
I get it baked now.

263
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,799
Now quite tight for time
- just need to make sure

264
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,799
it's cooked in the middle.

265
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,799
Sometimes this takes 30 minutes,
sometimes it takes 40 minutes.

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,799
If it takes 40 minutes, I
haven't got time to bake it.

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,799
It's in, there's nothing more
I can do about it, it's just

268
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
whether it cooks.

269
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,799
Couronne, let's be having ya!

270
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
You've got 10 minutes left. SQUEALS: No!

271
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
SHE SIGHS Oh, I don't know.

272
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,799
How do you know with bread that
it's cooked on the inside?

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,799
Can you do the needle? I'll use a
thermometer. Aiming for 85 degrees.

274
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
82. Not cooked.

275
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:40,799
It's definitely spreading, hopefully
I've got enough time to drizzle

276
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,799
a bit of melted chocolate
and caramel over it.

277
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,799
The temperature is all right, but
I feel like it could do with

278
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
a little bit longer.

279
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It doesn't feel done.

280
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,799
Oh, Jane's is out of the oven.

281
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,799
Do you think it's cooked?
I think it's cooked.

282
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
If Paul says it isn't... Answer to me.

283
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,799
Oh, it's large. It just want to
check the bottom. Yeah, that'll do.

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,799
OK, bakers, that's five minutes.

285
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,799
Please be cooked, I beg you.
It'll be what it will be.

286
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,799
It's got to come out.

287
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,799
Hopefully this hasn't stuck
to the sides of the tin.

288
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
That's not burning, is it? Just...
sorry, sorry, sorry.

289
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Glaze, glaze, glaze.

290
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,799
We've got, like, two
minutes - is that right?

291
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,799
Right, my bread-ren, you
have one minute left.

292
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
The question is, is it done?

293
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
It's going to have to come out.

294
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm happy with how it looks.

295
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,799
I've got to get it out of the tin, though.

296
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Cool, cool.

297
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,799
I need to turn it, so... put that on top.

298
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,799
Yeah, that's it. What can
we do, Candice? Nothing.

299
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,799
I hate oven gloves.

300
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,799
Oh, no! It's all right, don't panic.
I've squashed it!

301
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,799
Don't panic. It's going to
have to stay like that.

302
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,799
Bready or not, here we come. Time is up!

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,799
MEL: Move your breads to the
end of your stations, please.

304
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,799
It looks horrendous.

305
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Candice, step away from the couronne!

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,799
I think the overall colour looks nice...

307
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,799
Look at that. Oh.

308
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
There's good distribution of your
chocolate. It's pretty even.

309
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,799
I love that.

310
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,799
The flavour is excellent and it is
baked well and I think the choice

311
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,799
of proving it once was probably
the right way. Well done.

312
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Phew. Really, very good.

313
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,799
It is exceptionally heavy... Is it?
..which worries me a little bit.

314
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,799
When you choose a flavour to go in a bread,

315
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,799
you must choose something that
imparts flavour but not weight -

316
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,799
unless you've got plenty
of time to make it.

317
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,799
That's not cooked even on the top. Yeah.

318
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,799
Is that wallpaper paste? No!

319
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Oh, no.

320
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,799
It's spent a little bit too
long in the oven, I think.

321
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
See, I just hope you baked
it all the way through.

322
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,799
The orange flavour can trick you
into thinking that it is burnt.

323
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I don't think it is burnt at all.

324
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,799
I'm definitely getting an overcooked crust.

325
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
I'd just like to have seen
stronger flavours coming through.

326
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,799
I think the colour of the loaf
is good, but one of the things

327
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,799
I can see is down at the bottom...

328
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,799
Not quite done. Yeah, it's not quite done.

329
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
..it is quite raw. Yeah.

330
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,799
The chocolate is good but it's not done.

331
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,799
What I would've done is
put less chocolate in

332
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
and had less curls in there.

333
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,799
Nice colour, nice shape.

334
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,799
And a little surprise in the
middle of each one. Yeah.

335
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,799
Going by what's on the
knife, it's still melted.

336
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,799
Oh, still melted in the middle.
Yeah. Ooh, look. You're fine.

337
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,799
Oh, no. Here we go. I can
see it's a bit under-baked.

338
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
I can tell you straightaway.

339
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,799
As soon as you add liquid, you
haven't got the time for this.

340
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,799
No. You were probably
about five minutes away.

341
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I knew I was close. I could kick myself.
I knew I was close.

342
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,799
I think it looks great. Oh, thank you.
Love the colour.

343
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,799
Let's have a quick look inside.

344
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,799
Mmm.

345
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,799
You're going to tell me
it's not baked, aren't you?

346
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,799
That's exactly what I'm going to say.

347
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,799
You see how light it is
there in texture? Yep.

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
And there how dense it is?

349
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:34,799
Absolutely delicious, but
you had masses of filling.

350
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,799
I did, yes. I did. A mountain of pecans.

351
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
It's so big it's going to take
a long time to cook. Yeah.

352
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,799
It has collapsed, which
makes it look a mess.

353
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Mm-hm. But it is down to the eat on this.

354
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,799
It's such a shame it's not done.
It really... Oh.

355
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,799
Oh, Paul, do you have to do that?

356
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,799
You can see the dough is still raw inside.

357
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,799
With all the love in the world,
I'm not going to eat it.

358
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It's so big.

359
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,799
To try and get that done
in the two and half hours

360
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,799
is quite difficult. I'm really embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.

361
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,799
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

362
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,799
What it is is you tend to fly out there

363
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
with lots of things going inside.

364
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,799
Rein it in a little bit.. Rein it in.

365
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,799
..and then slowly get your
baking absolutely spot on. Yeah.

366
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,799
All right? Yeah. Thank you very much.

367
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,799
Thank you very much. Onwards and upwards.

368
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,799
Onwards and upwards. Don't overanalyze.
OK. Move on.

369
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,799
That was mortifying.

370
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
He wouldn't taste.

371
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,799
You start off, you think,
"Where's the chilli?"

372
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,799
And now it is hitting me.
Is it hitting you?

373
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,799
Yeah. Ooh! PAUL COUGHS

374
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,799
The chocolate flavour is good.

375
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,799
The chilli is far too much. It's
destroying the chocolate flavour.

376
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
I think you slightly
under-baked it, as well.

377
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,799
Is it a loaf? I think it's a load
of Chelsea buns glued together.

378
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
That's what you've got.

379
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,799
It's a nice idea, though. It's
a very clever way of doing it.

380
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,799
Really wise to choose
something that's shallow

381
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,799
because it's got time to cook
through and have a rise.

382
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,799
There's a hint of chilli there.
It is not knocking me out.

383
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,799
It's a very good bread.

384
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,799
The chocolate is there, the
hazelnut is there. Excellent.

385
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,799
Thank you. Well done, Tom. Thank you.

386
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,800
And breathe. HE EXHALES

387
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Happy with that? I hope so.

388
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,799
Love it.

389
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,799
Really? Yeah. Chocolate is
strong all the way through.

390
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,799
Cardamom is beautiful in that dough.

391
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,799
It is a lovely flavour.

392
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,799
The fact that Rav made a
slightly smaller loaf

393
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,799
than some of the other bakers...
That helps... that helps, yeah.

394
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,799
Thank you very much. You're blushing.

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,799
Paul said he loved my bread
- I was stunned into silence.

396
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, my God.

397
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:04,799
When he went, "I'm not sure
I'd call this a loaf,"

398
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,799
I was like, "Oh, but please do.

399
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,799
"Please come to the conclusion it is."

400
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,799
I knew when Paul raised his eyebrows
when he saw me filling my bread

401
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
that there might be an issue.

402
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:18,799
It was slightly... I wouldn't say
burnt, but I like it crispy.

403
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,799
Well, that was a fall from grace, hey?

404
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
THUNDER RUMBLES

405
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Bread Week isn't about to get any easier.

406
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,799
Bakers, for our Technical Challenge today,

407
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,799
we turned to the bread expert.

408
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
But sadly, she wasn't available,

409
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,799
so we asked Paul instead if he'd
like to contribute a recipe.

410
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,799
Paul, do you have any wise words?

411
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,799
We've never done anything
like this on Bake Off before.

412
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,799
It's notoriously difficult.

413
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,799
More scaremongering than anything else.

414
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,799
If you'd like to both go
back to your enclosures.

415
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,799
Goodbye, Mary and Paul. Take care.
Or should I say auf Wiedersehen?

416
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,799
Because Paul and Mary would
like you to make Dampfnudel.

417
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,799
Dampfnudel? Yes.

418
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,799
Paul would like you to make 12 Dampfnudel,

419
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,799
and just to give you a little clue,

420
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,799
the word Dampf in German means steam.

421
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,799
Paul would like this
served with two sauces.

422
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,799
You've got two hours for this,
so on your marks... Get set.

423
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
BOTH: Bake.

424
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,799
Oh!

425
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,799
I was thinking crumpet, a
bit of toast, be fine, hey?

426
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Dampfnudel.

427
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,799
I have no idea what a Dampfnudel is.

428
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,799
This is going to be purely
based on intuition.

429
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
This is just so weird.

430
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,799
What do you think of them, Mary?
Bit different, isn't it?

431
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,799
Dampfnudel. They're a sort of dumpling.

432
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,799
Why did you choose this?

433
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,799
We've never actually steamed
bread before on the Bake Off,

434
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,799
so it's the first time
that any of the bakers

435
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,799
would've hit anything like
this in their lives, probably.

436
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,799
One of the problems with this
is once the rolls are actually

437
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,799
on the heat and beginning to steam,

438
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,799
they may be tempted lift the
lid off to have a quick look.

439
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,799
The moment that they lift that
lid off, they'll begin to drop.

440
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,799
I'm intrigued to know what
the underneath is like.

441
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,799
Now, you can see the caramelisation
underneath from the sugar,

442
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,799
so it's browned underneath.

443
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,799
I'm going to give you a little
bit of plum sauce there

444
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,799
and the custard, or the creme anglaise.

445
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,799
So, what we're actually
testing them on is knowing

446
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,799
when dough is actually cooked through -

447
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,799
in this case, steamed through.

448
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,799
Just like an iced bun without the icing.

449
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
That's exactly what it is.

450
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
These are completely alien to me.

451
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:30,799
I've never seen them, never heard of them.

452
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,799
First instruction is, "Make
a Dampfnudel dough."

453
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,799
And that's all it says.

454
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
It says to use warm milk,

455
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,799
which should just get the yeast going

456
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
with the melted butter in there,

457
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,799
and then I'm going to
knead it into a dough.

458
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,799
It's didn't say anything about kneading it,

459
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,799
but I'm going to give it a bit of a knead.

460
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,799
I think it's going to be
like a sweet dumpling.

461
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,799
I've made dumplings loads of times.

462
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,799
I'm going to knead until
it's springy to the touch,

463
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
and then I hope that it's correct.

464
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,799
Selasi, you're very dramatic
with that kneading. Unnecessary.

465
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,799
Trying to intimidate the other bakers.

466
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,799
LAUGHTER

467
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,799
It says, "Prove," but it doesn't
say how long to prove it for.

468
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,799
I'm going to prove it till
it's doubled in size.

469
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,799
I might do it for an hour,
so let's see how that goes.

470
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Boom.

471
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,799
I've gone for a conservative 50 minutes.

472
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,799
So, I'm going to save up 30 minutes

473
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,799
and then I'm going to take
a look at that point.

474
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,799
Making Dampfnudel for Paul and
Mary might be nerve-racking,

475
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,799
but there was a time
when these steamed buns

476
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
were a matter of life or death.

477
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,799
The Dampfnudel first came to
prominence in the 17th century

478
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,799
during one of the longest
conflicts in European history -

479
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,799
the Thirty Years' War.

480
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Unpaid and hungry,

481
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,799
Swedish soldiers were ravaging Germany,

482
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,799
looting towns as they went,

483
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,799
until they reached the
gates of Freckenfeld.

484
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Imagine the scene -

485
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:57,799
a starving, angry army all
set to pillage the village

486
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,799
when up pops local baker Johannes Muck,

487
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,799
who offers to feed them all himself.

488
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Brave bloke.

489
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:07,799
All he has to do is knock up several
hundred batches of Dampfnudel -

490
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,799
by this afternoon, please
- or the village gets it.

491
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,799
He, his wife and one of his apprentices

492
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,799
made 1,286 Dampfnudeln.

493
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
That's a lot of Dampfnudeln.

494
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:23,799
Yes, never before had so much
Dampfnudeln been made in one day.

495
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,799
A peace treaty through dumplings.

496
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,799
It's the way forward, surely.

497
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,799
To mark Johannes' yeast-laden heroism,

498
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,799
his grandson built a monumental gate
catchily known as das Dampfnudeltor.

499
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,799
He made stone buns,

500
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,799
the same quantity as they
made in Dampfnudeln.

501
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
1,286. 86.

502
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,799
400 years later, the Dampfnudel
still holds a special place

503
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,799
in the hearts of the Freckenfeld townsfolk.

504
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,799
It's celebrated in an annual festival,

505
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,799
and even features on their coat of arms.

506
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,799
And if that wasn't enough...

507
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,799
the Germans have also written
a song about the Dampfnudel.

508
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,799
Coldplay, watch your back.
Take it away, lads.

509
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
THEY SING IN GERMAN

510
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,799
One hour remaining to make 12 Dampfnudel.

511
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,799
A voyage of discovery.

512
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,799
And as their dough proves,

513
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,799
Paul's recipe demands they begin
preparing the first of two sauces.

514
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,799
And all it says is make
a smooth plum sauce.

515
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,799
Great.

516
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,799
I've never made a plum sauce before.

517
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,799
I'm just thinking this
is how you would do it.

518
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,799
Like, soften your plums with the juice,

519
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,799
add in the sugar and
then just cook it down.

520
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,799
I think you want the colour
from the skin to get any sort

521
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,799
of colour and flavour out of that,

522
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,799
and then just sieve it once it's done.

523
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,799
It said smooth plum sauce, so
smooth is what they'll get.

524
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,800
It's quite thick. This
is more like a puree.

525
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
It's been in for about 40 minutes.

526
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
I'm going to weigh it...

527
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
It is 900.

528
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,799
Now, I'm going to divide it into 12 bowls.

529
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm just working out what that will be,

530
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,800
so I've got to try to do some maths.

531
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,799
What's 900 divided by 12?

532
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,799
900 divided by 12...

533
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
50...

534
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:28,799
Sort of... Eight... 80 something?

535
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,799
Let's do it. Four, eight, 12, 16...

536
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,799
900. 90... 75. Oh, I had 80, just over...

537
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,799
The most painful, painful hour of
television you will ever watch.

538
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Between us, we've got it. Thanks.

539
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Is there a way to roll it?
Is there? I don't know.

540
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,799
Kate. How are your balls? I'm
just pinching their bottoms.

541
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,799
Very, very good. No-one
wants the seam showing.

542
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,799
What is that? That's poaching liquid.

543
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Do they sit in that?

544
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:57,799
It says, "Off the heat, add the
dough balls to the poaching liquid,

545
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,799
"and leave for a second
prove." You're quite calm.

546
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,799
I don't know what I'm doing,
so if I get it horribly wrong,

547
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,799
it doesn't really matter because...
Well, no, that's right.

548
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,799
Because these will always be the
best Dampfnudel I've ever made.

549
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
That is for sure.

550
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,800
I have no idea how long
the second prove will be.

551
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,799
It's a juggle between longer to
prove, and then less time to cook.

552
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm just going to put them
back in for the second prove.

553
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,799
GERMAN ACCENT: OK, my darlings.

554
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,799
News just in, you have 30 minutes
to complete your lovely Dampfnudel.

555
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,799
You'll need to be steaming those
buns and let them puff up

556
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
like the golden balls
of magic that they are.

557
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,799
NORMAL ACCENT: I've never eaten one.

558
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I'm beginning to think I probably
ought to get them cooking.

559
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,799
Time to steam.

560
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,799
I think I might give them a 15-minute cook?

561
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,799
It doesn't say how long you're
supposed to be steaming them for,

562
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,799
so it's just going by eye.

563
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Step seven is steam the dough balls,

564
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:53,799
and step eight is make a vanilla custard.

565
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,799
I feel like making the custard
is a hint as to how long

566
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,799
to steam them for, so basically
when the custard's done,

567
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm going to take the lid off.

568
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,799
Even if they think they know

569
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,799
what a cooked Dampfnudel
should look like...

570
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,799
Turn that up ever so slightly.

571
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
..steaming makes it
almost impossible to see.

572
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I have no idea what I'm looking for.

573
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,799
You're not alone, you're not alone.

574
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,799
I've estimated it at about 15 minutes.

575
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
So, I've got about six minutes left.

576
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,799
And I don't want to lift
the lid before then,

577
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,799
cos they're meant to be
really humid, I think.

578
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Like dumplings.

579
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,800
It's looking good. I should
stop opening it, actually.

580
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Definitely on the move.

581
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Yeah.

582
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Three... Two... One.

583
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
They're quite big.

584
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,799
They've gone huge!

585
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
They've been in 15 minutes.

586
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,799
I'm amazed. I think they're wonderful.

587
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,799
It says, "Cook until they're crisp."

588
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,799
I'm not really going to
know when they're crisp.

589
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,799
Apart from stopping it before
I smell a burning smell.

590
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,799
I'm kind of touching them,
they're dry on the top.

591
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,799
So now we're just reducing this down

592
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,799
and hopefully getting
golden, crispy bottoms.

593
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
But there's a lot of liquid still in here.

594
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,799
Hopefully there's enough time to do it.

595
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,799
You have got five minutes
before the noodles of doom

596
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
need to hit Paul's mouth.

597
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,799
I'm struggling. They're
cooking at different speeds.

598
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,799
Just trying to make sure
that I don't burn some bits

599
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,799
and leave other bits raw.

600
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,799
Might turn it down to number one.

601
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,799
I can smell... Yeah. Going
to turn it down a bit.

602
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,799
It's definitely now
starting to crispen it up.

603
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
You can start to smell it.

604
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,799
Is that coming from mine?

605
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,799
There's a bit of smoke coming...
Little bit of smoke, Selasi.

606
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,799
It's like, the kind of burn that you like.
Let's call it caramelised.

607
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
That's it. Yeah. As long as you
believe that, Selasi. Yeah.

608
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,799
They're definitely not crisp underneath.
I hate them.

609
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
I absolutely hate them.

610
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,800
That's horrible, isn't it?

611
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,799
That one is certainly brown on the bottom.
They're springing back.

612
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,799
That's all I got to go on, currently.

613
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,799
One of them looks a bit underdone.

614
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,799
But the others are cooked, and
are burning on the bottom.

615
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,799
I don't know why I'm shaking them.
Should they be separate?

616
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I don't know.

617
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,799
They don't look particularly appetising.

618
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,799
Please be good. Please.

619
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,799
OK, bakers. That's it, your time is up.

620
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,799
Rising fear in the tent.

621
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,799
Also rising dampf.

622
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Please bring up the Dampfnudeln.

623
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,799
Paul and Mary will have no idea
whose Dampfnudel are whose.

624
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,799
What we're looking for is
12 equal steamed buns,

625
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,799
cooked all the way through,
with a brown base.

626
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,799
So we'll start from this side.

627
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
It's got a bit bounce of to it,

628
00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:59,800
which means that they feel as though
they're actually cooked there.

629
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,799
They've overcooked it slightly.

630
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,799
But it's actually cooked
all the way through.

631
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,799
The plum sauce looks beautifully
clear, just the right consistency.

632
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,799
That's pretty good.

633
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,799
What makes those wrinkly, all on top?

634
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,799
Could have brought them off too
early, so they've shrunk back down.

635
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,799
That is black. Oh, it is.

636
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
It is black. It is.

637
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:25,799
Now, that one is raw. Difficult to eat.

638
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I mean, you've got raw dough.

639
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,799
Now, this looks smooth.

640
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,799
They have that nice dome,
which they should have. Yes.

641
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,799
It is cooked. The plum sauce is good.

642
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,799
And, actually, the Dampfnudel's
got a great taste to it.

643
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,799
These are...

644
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,799
raw pieces of dough.

645
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,799
So, you're going to have
the dough on the top...

646
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,799
Oh, there you go, dough underneath, too.

647
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,799
So what you can actually do with this one,

648
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
is turn it back into a dough.

649
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Massively under-proved.

650
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,799
Well cooked through. But
they're just minute.

651
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,799
Let's have a quick look. Good colour
underneath. Brown on the bottom.

652
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,799
We have got that.

653
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,799
It's very close-textured, and when I
squeeze it, it stays down. Mm-hm.

654
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,799
But it tastes great. And the
sauces are pretty good, too.

655
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,799
Now, these feel like
they're cooked through.

656
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Undercooked at the top.

657
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,799
Which means they may have opened
the lid a little bit too early.

658
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,799
This is really rather thick, this sauce.

659
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,799
Do you want a hacksaw, Mary, to get it...?
There it is.

660
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,799
No, no, it's just a little bit overboiled.

661
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Now, this looks quite well-domed.
And actually well cooked, as well.

662
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
It's slightly underdone, this one.

663
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,799
Oh, they were minutes away.

664
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,799
Bit overcooked on the bottom. Yes.
Massively overcooked on the bottom.

665
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,799
The texture's not that bad.
It is cooked through.

666
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,799
Plum sauce is a little bit too thick.

667
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,799
Custard is pretty good.

668
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,799
Next one. We have a little
bit of raw dough on the top.

669
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,799
Nice colour underneath, though.
Needed longer in the steamer.

670
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,799
And you can see it straightaway.

671
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,800
So, the top quarter is raw, but
right down the bottom is OK.

672
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,799
Last one. We have raw dough again.

673
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
(Oh, no.)

674
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:13,799
Good colour underneath. Lot of dough.

675
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,799
It is cooked down at the bottom, though.

676
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,799
Sauce consistency is fine.

677
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,799
Good flavour.

678
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
OK.

679
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,799
Paul and Mary will now rank the Dampfnudel

680
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
from the worst to the best.

681
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,799
In 10th place, who's this?

682
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,799
That's me.

683
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
They're not done.

684
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,799
In ninth place is this one. Whose was this?

685
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Oh, that's me.

686
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:37,799
The size was good, but
it was pretty inedible.

687
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,799
Kate is eighth. Michael seventh.

688
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,799
Benjamina sixth. Selasi fifth.

689
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,799
And Tom is fourth.

690
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,799
In third place is this one.

691
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,799
Pretty good. Overall, the sauces were good.

692
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
And it was edible.

693
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,800
And in second place...

694
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,799
Properly cooked through,
and two nice sauces.

695
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,799
And in first place.

696
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
APPLAUSE

697
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,799
Overall, it was the one I
thought was closest to mine.

698
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Still a million miles away...

699
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
LAUGHTER

700
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:13,799
But closest to mine. I aspire, I aspire.

701
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,799
Well done, Barb. Thank you. Well done.

702
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,799
I'm absolutely amazed.

703
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,799
It's pure luck that I'm
older than everybody else,

704
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,799
and maybe I've just made more
dumplings than anybody else.

705
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,799
It's nice to end the day
on a high, for a change.

706
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,799
I'm feeling better. I am
feeling a lot better.

707
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,799
The idea was that I'd get better
as these two days progress,

708
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
but actually I've got worse.

709
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:35,799
The worst thing for me was
when the dough was so raw

710
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,799
that he formed it into a ball.

711
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
I thought he was going
to throw it at someone!

712
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,799
So, the bakers had a bit
of a mixed day yesterday.

713
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,799
There seemed to be quite
a lot of raw dough.

714
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,799
There's a large group that are in trouble.

715
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,799
Unusually, Jane.

716
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,799
Oh, she was Star Baker in week one!
What is Jane doing down there? Kate.

717
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,799
Kate! She did so well last week.

718
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,799
Michael. Benjamina, she's beginning
to stumble a little bit.

719
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Andrew has fared really well.

720
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:09,799
Would you see him in contention for
Star Baker, Mary? He could be.

721
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,799
As is Tom. Val seems to have done
much better in the technical.

722
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,799
Rav and Candice, they're both
in the middle there. Yeah.

723
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,799
So, if they have a good day
today, it could save them,

724
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,799
or could actually catapult them down again.
You've gone from saying,

725
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,799
"There's quite a large group
of people in trouble,"

726
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,799
to, "Everyone's in trouble." Pretty much.

727
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,799
And a lot of it is resting
on how they perform today.

728
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Well, it's all a huge surprise,
what's happened up until now.

729
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,799
Welcome to Showstopper Day.

730
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,799
Now, Mary and Paul would love you to make

731
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,799
a savoury plaited centrepiece.

732
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,799
It can be any shape or size.

733
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,799
It should have three flours within it.

734
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,799
You have four hours to
complete this challenge.

735
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,800
On your marks, get set... Bake!

736
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,799
This bake really needs to
go really, really well.

737
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,799
What am I going to do first?

738
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,799
MARY: The Showstopper
has to be spectacular.

739
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,799
And it's got to be a whopping loaf.

740
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,799
Imagine using three flours -

741
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,799
if they're twisted together
they rise at a different time.

742
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,799
When you're doing your plait, you've
got to make sure each of the strands

743
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,799
are exactly the same shape and width.

744
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,799
What you want is a
beautiful, uniform plait,

745
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,799
and that is quite tricky to do.

746
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
The Star Baker of Bread Week

747
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:28,800
has always gone on to the final
of Bake Off. Watch this space.

748
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,799
Good morning. Morning, Kate. Hello.
Tell us all about your savoury loaf.

749
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,799
I've combined two traditions
that we have in the family.

750
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,799
One's making corn dolls, and
one's making the harvest loaf.

751
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,799
What plaits are you doing? These
are four-string plaits...

752
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,799
They're four, yeah. And this is
like an eight-string herringbone.

753
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,799
Gracious me.

754
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Kate's ambitious corn maiden

755
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,799
contains goat's cheese and onion focaccia,

756
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
beer-flavoured rye plaits,

757
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,799
and spelt ears of corn filled with Cheddar.

758
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Well, have you got a corn doll?

759
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:58,799
I have, it's one my children made, so...
Let's have a look.

760
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,799
MEL: Isn't that a fertility symbol, Kate?
I think it may be.

761
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,799
This is very fertile, this, isn't it? Yeah.

762
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,799
Do you want to have more children, Kate?
Absolutely not.

763
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,799
I love the ones I've got. Yes. But...
You're not planning on any...

764
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
No, no more, no.

765
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,799
Michael's savoury plaited centrepiece
is also a family affair.

766
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,799
I'm making Cypriot-inspired
plaited loaf bread.

767
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,799
Drawing on my inspiration of my grandma,

768
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,799
and baking at home with
her, and stuff like that.

769
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,799
So it definitely is like
a traditional Cypriot

770
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,799
flavour combination.

771
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,799
If it goes down well with
Paul, it would be good.

772
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,799
I know he knows the flavours quite well.

773
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,799
Michael will celebrate the
year his family's homeland

774
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,799
became independent by
recreating the Cypriot flag

775
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,799
with plaited breads flavoured with olives,

776
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,799
coriander and sun-dried tomatoes.

777
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,799
I heard, as well, that there's
family alcohol. Yeah.

778
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,799
Are you talking about zivania?
Yeah. Zivania?

779
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,799
It's about 99% proof. Could
strip paint off a car.

780
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,799
This one... This one probably is.

781
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,799
It's from one of my aunts' villages.
Wow. It's pretty strong. Oh.

782
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,799
You'll be fine, Mary. Yeah.

783
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,799
Just have it after your other
breads, so can actually taste them.

784
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Good luck.

785
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,799
Today, I'm making two types
of rye and one kamut bread.

786
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,799
The only thing I can liken it
to is like a spelt-type flour.

787
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,799
It's quite natty.

788
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,799
Candice's plaited kamut will be
filled with mozzarella and olives.

789
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
It'll sit on top of

790
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,799
a light and dark rye twist.

791
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,799
So I do the knead three times
over, knead it for ten seconds,

792
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,799
leave it for ten minutes,
knead it for ten seconds...

793
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,799
Two... Three...

794
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
It worked really nicely at home.

795
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,799
Kneading is now more crucial than ever.

796
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,799
The plaited centrepieces
will only hold their shape

797
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,799
if the bakers have built up
enough gluten in the dough.

798
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,799
So, the key thing is both managing
time and making sure I get

799
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,799
the right bits thick enough
that it supports the loaf.

800
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,799
Andrew's large woven rye basket
will need to be strong enough

801
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,799
to support a wholemeal pesto-filled rim

802
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,799
and a giant handle flavoured
with orange and cardamom.

803
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,799
If it's not thick enough, it will lean.

804
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,799
I don't want a Leaning Tower of Basket.

805
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,799
But Andrew's centrepiece
may not be the biggest.

806
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,799
I'm doing a two-piece centrepiece.

807
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,799
One is good to be a serpent,
which is Jormungandr... Sorry?

808
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Jormungandr. And Mjolnir,
which is Thor's hammer.

809
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,799
The dark rye and spelt snake,

810
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,799
filled with cranberries and
walnuts, will feel the might of

811
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Thor's rye and spelt hammer,

812
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,799
flavoured with ale and seaweed.

813
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,799
What seaweed are you using?
I'm using laver.

814
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,799
Lava? Laver, yeah. As in a volcano?

815
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,799
As in colour. It's a
slightly out-there flavour.

816
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,799
But one I thought was interesting to try.

817
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,799
May the power of Thor be with you now.
Indeed!

818
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,799
But even Tom might not have
the largest Showstopper.

819
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,799
It's going to be a Noah's Ark.

820
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
So, Two By Two?

821
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:43,799
No, it's As They All Went Into The
Ark For To Get Out Of The Rain.

822
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,799
It's a hymn. As a plait?

823
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,799
Yes. It's plaited. So
it's a plaited ark hymn?

824
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Yes.

825
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,799
A white and wholemeal bread ark,

826
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,799
topped with a tomato and basil
flavoured roof, will rescue

827
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,799
an assortment of spelt bread animals.

828
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,799
There'll be an elephant.
One elephant? Or...?

829
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,799
The whole point is...

830
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
They've argued.

831
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,799
Two giraffes. Of course.

832
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
And there'll be a dove.

833
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
A dove? A dove.

834
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,799
Don't they need two? Need two doves?

835
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,799
Well, one's flown away.

836
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,799
I normally bake with very simple flours,

837
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
nothing too complicated.

838
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,799
I've never actually baked with spelt flour.

839
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,799
Selasi's spelt tear-and-share loaf
will be filled with dry-cured beef

840
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,799
and sun-dried tomatoes.

841
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,799
It will sit beneath a multi-seeded tree,

842
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,799
and a star-shaped loaf
topped with chillies.

843
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,799
We seem to have a tree,

844
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,799
and then a tear-and-share ball,
but they're not actually related?

845
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,799
On a trip to Egypt, we
went to a Bedouin tent,

846
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,799
and then we all sat under a tree

847
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,799
and just ate together and it
was just, like... Us sharing.

848
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,799
That's the whole piece. It's
a lovely story. Yeah. It is.

849
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
It is a lovely story. Yeah - Jackanory.

850
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,799
Proving multiple doughs
requires careful planning.

851
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,799
The variety of flours
used will mean each batch

852
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
will rise at a different rate.

853
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,799
I will not be serving
anyone raw dough today.

854
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,799
I really want to prove it
until it's doubled in size,

855
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,799
but I will compromise the proving
to make sure that my bread is

856
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,799
baked right through. And if multiple
proving wasn't hard enough...

857
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
That going to fit? ..at the same time...

858
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,799
..some bakers have set themselves
the extra task of making fillings.

859
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,799
This time I've gone a lot more
conservative than I did yesterday.

860
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,799
It was pretty hot.

861
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,799
So normally pesto is with pine nuts,

862
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,799
but I'm using walnuts and pistachios.

863
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,799
Benjamina is pinning her hopes
on her pesto and feta filled

864
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,799
spelt spirals which will top
her onion and tomato rye loaf.

865
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,799
How are you feeling? Oh, this has
got to be good. Do you feel that?

866
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,799
I'm just a bit... I just want it to bake.
It's just got to bake.

867
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,799
Because the first one was raw.
It would be good, wouldn't it?

868
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
It would be good if it was cooked.

869
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:51,799
I'm using ingredients that you
won't necessarily find in pesto.

870
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Garlic, it's got ginger, coriander...

871
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,799
It's got some chillies in
it and it tastes good.

872
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,799
Rav's spiced pesto will fill
the bottom tier of his Diwali

873
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
centrepiece.

874
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:02,799
His other layers will be filled
with a fragrant coconut and masala

875
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,799
chutney. What's your favourite? I
think that's my favourite. That.

876
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,799
That? That is the coconut chutney.
Shut your eyes.

877
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,799
No, I've played Guess The Smell
with you before and come a cropper.

878
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,799
Can I say, this is a
terribly difficult game.

879
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Let's play Melanie's Guess The Smell.
Right, Guess The Smell.

880
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Tell me when the smell is present,

881
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:22,800
cos I'm just getting you at the
moment and it's really unpleasant.

882
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Is it there? Yep.

883
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:26,799
That's nothing, that's metal.

884
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,799
LAUGHTER

885
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Smell The Timer, that's my new game!

886
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,799
I want to slowly cook down
the chorizo to release

887
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,799
all that lovely... aroma.

888
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,799
Oh, it smells so good.

889
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,799
Jane's chorizo and chilli

890
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,799
will fill the plaited
ring of her centrepiece.

891
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,799
The middle will be stuffed with

892
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
pecan, Parmesan and pesto.

893
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:50,799
Showstopper day. Don't, I've been
worrying all night about it.

894
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,799
Did you sleep? Up until about four o'clock.

895
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,799
Listen, there's a lot riding on this
day for many people in this tent.

896
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,799
There is. There really is.

897
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,799
You're not alone in that.

898
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,799
Well, I'm going to take advice from
yesterday - turn the oven down,

899
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,799
cook it for a bit longer.

900
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,799
Long and low.

901
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Bye-bye, Jane. Bye-bye.

902
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,799
All right, my arty Vincent van
Doughs, you've got two hours left.

903
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,799
I need to...

904
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,799
turn this into a basket.

905
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,799
The bakers now need to act fast.

906
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
That's looking all right.

907
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:30,800
They need to fill, plait and shape
their loaves for a second prove...

908
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,799
..but be careful to leave
enough time for baking.

909
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,799
Paul said yesterday about being
careful not to overladen

910
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
your bread with ingredients.

911
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,799
I would at home probably shove all that in,

912
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
but I'm going to be good,
so I don't overstuff it.

913
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Adding my olives to my kamut.

914
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,799
It's really important to be precise
so that all the braids are

915
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,799
the same size, so the braids look uniform.

916
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,799
Just trying to remember how to plait, now.
This one goes under...

917
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,799
I won't say my plaiting
skills are the best.

918
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Anything above three strands, I can't do.

919
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,799
You've got to give it
enough room to expand,

920
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,799
otherwise it just gets into one big glob.

921
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Right over...

922
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Still not right! NERVOUS LAUGH

923
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Nope.

924
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:20,800
This is the most
concentrated I can ever be.

925
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,799
It needs to have a flat base and a
flat top. I haven't plaited a lot.

926
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,799
I was busy playing football
and watching the girls!

927
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,799
You take the string on the left
under the middle two strings,

928
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,799
back over the last one.

929
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,799
I don't think the four-string
plaits are too difficult.

930
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,799
I used to do this with my pony's tail.

931
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,799
This is the serpent.
It's a six-strand plait.

932
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,799
Just poking in some mozzarella
before it goes for its second prove.

933
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,799
All the careful plaiting could
be undone in the second prove.

934
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,799
I'm going to leave it to prove for...
40 minutes.

935
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,799
The bakers need to ensure it doesn't
expand too much and lose its shape,

936
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,799
while at the same time continuing
to plait their remaining elements.

937
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,799
The shape that you've created here...

938
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,799
It's very male, isn't it?

939
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,799
Yes, it's a hammer, strong,

940
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
it's also a T.

941
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:10,799
T for Thor, T for Tom.

942
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,799
I'm not being led. My mum's
going to watch this!

943
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,799
She's coming out, but I've got about
six minutes before she needs to

944
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,799
go in the oven, so I'm going to
just start popping these on her.

945
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,799
She will get as many plaits as I've made.

946
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,799
Everyone apart from Kate has
at least two loaves to bake...

947
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,799
I've really got to crack on. I'm
going to get that one in the oven.

948
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
..and only one oven.

949
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
That's it, the serpent in the oven.

950
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,799
CUT GLASS ACCENT: Bakers, half
an hour left on this challenge.

951
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,799
Well BREAD(!)

952
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,799
I don't know why I made
such ruddy large loaves.

953
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,799
Could really do with another oven!

954
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,799
(You can do it.) She's in.

955
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,799
So now the Jormungandr cools,

956
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,799
and we'll bake the hammer.

957
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,799
And we've got about 30 minutes left.

958
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,799
These take about 25 minutes,

959
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,799
so we're cutting it quite fine.

960
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,799
It's a trade-off between
having that one cooked

961
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
or having this one cooked!

962
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,800
Cos I think that could
use another 5 minutes.

963
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,799
Is it? Isn't it? It should be...

964
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,799
85 to 90 degrees C in the middle.

965
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,799
It should be cooked.

966
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,799
Every time I've made it before, when
it's been hollow, it's been cooked,

967
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,799
but with all the raw dough that's
been flying around, I'm just...

968
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,799
hyper paranoid.

969
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I'm quite happy with that.

970
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:28,799
I've got a bit of time for it to cool down.

971
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Not cooked.

972
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,799
It's the problem when you've got a
big lump of dough for an elephant,

973
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,799
it does take a long while to cook.

974
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,799
Yesterday Paul said my loaf
was minutes off being cooked.

975
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,799
So... I'm giving it the minutes.

976
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,800
Bakers, you've got five minutes
to get your plaits out.

977
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,799
I'm going to go until we
have one minute spare.

978
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,799
Come on - cook. Cook!

979
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,799
Come on, now.

980
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,799
Be cooked.

981
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,799
Is it an elephant or a tortoise, Val?
And these are...

982
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,799
Slugs? No...

983
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Giraffes! Oh, blast!

984
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,799
Quick, Val - bandage it up, bandage
it up, old girl. There we go.

985
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Val, health and safety, Val. Hold it.
Look, I've got a big old split.

986
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
HOLLOW THUDDING

987
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
METALLIC CRASH Sh!

988
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
It's coming out.

989
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,800
This is the Cypriot flag.
It's got to come out...

990
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
..cooked or not.

991
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,799
Bakers, let's put this challenge to BREAD.

992
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,799
Time is up, move your bakes to
the end of your work stations,

993
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
thank you. Well done.

994
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,800
(I'm worried about it. Don't be worried.)

995
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Jane, would you like to bring up
your savoury plaited centrepiece?

996
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,799
It is a beautiful colour. Thank you.

997
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,799
The definition on the outside is there,

998
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,799
but there's a lot of breaks in this.
It is baked beautifully.

999
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
This is the one with the chorizo in it.

1000
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,799
The paprika in there is lovely.

1001
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,799
The whole flavours on the outside
are delicious and the texture

1002
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,799
is very good, as well. Oh, thank you.

1003
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,799
And this one is the pesto one. Yes.

1004
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,799
I like it. Oh, thank you. Mm!

1005
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,799
Nice bit of spring on there,
lots of flavour, good plaiting.

1006
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,799
I think it's absolutely beautiful.
Well done. Oh, thank you so much.

1007
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
What a splendid loaf to start with!

1008
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
I can't really see which is Noah's
Ark and which is the animals.

1009
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,799
Is that a chicken? It's
a giraffe, Paul. Ah.

1010
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,799
It's a bit...

1011
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
It's not a mess, it's informal.

1012
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
This is raw.

1013
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,799
The smell is amazing, though.
Lovely flavour.

1014
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Now, our elephant here
also looks underbaked.

1015
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,799
Yeah, this one is raw.

1016
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,799
Getting to the ark, it's a bit doughy. Yep.

1017
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,799
Ooh, bit salty, as well.

1018
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
That was the idea of it. Good one, Val.
Like the sea? Yep.

1019
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Right, OK.

1020
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:48,799
You can do design.

1021
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
The idea is fantastic,

1022
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,800
but I don't think it was
executed to a high standard.

1023
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,799
Your proving is very
good cos it's very bold,

1024
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,799
it's round, it's shiny, it's equal.

1025
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,799
The plaiting is excellent.

1026
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
I think you've done a very
good job from the outside.

1027
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,799
When you put some cranberries
in there, walnuts in there,

1028
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,799
you expect to have at least that
in every single bite and you're

1029
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
just not getting that.

1030
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:25,799
The texture is spot-on and the
bake is very, very good, too.

1031
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,799
This has got stout... And seaweed, as well.

1032
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,799
The bake and texture on this is spot-on.

1033
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,799
I've never had seaweed in bread before.

1034
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
I like it.

1035
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,799
It certainly does look a centrepiece,

1036
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,799
which is what we've asked for. And
it has a beautifully defined plait.

1037
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,799
It is a weave rather than a joined up...
You have big gaps, there.

1038
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
These are too big.

1039
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,799
The flavour of the cardamom
and orange is beautiful.

1040
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Perfect balance between the two.

1041
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:10,799
But the flavour of all three
are very, very good. OK.

1042
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Well done, Andrew. Very good, well done.

1043
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,799
A pith helmet of bread. Just adorned...

1044
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,800
with our love.

1045
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,800
The design looks great. Bold, big
beautiful. And a glorious colour.

1046
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,799
That's a lovely flavour. Very good.

1047
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,799
Feta and the herbs combination is stunning.

1048
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Onions give it a good flavour.

1049
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

1050
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,799
Quite hot. It's got a bit of
heat in there, hasn't it?

1051
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
Let's move onto the next one.

1052
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,799
It tastes lovely. You could have
put more flavour in there, though.

1053
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
This was wholemeal? Yes.

1054
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,799
The filling is delicious,

1055
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,800
but the actual bread itself
just doesn't have the spring.

1056
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,799
So this is the tree. Yes.

1057
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,799
And this is to represent...

1058
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,799
That was meant to be a star.

1059
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,799
I can't see a visible plait,
it's all over the place.

1060
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,799
Very close texture.

1061
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,799
It's not strong enough on the flavour.

1062
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,799
You can toast some of the seeds
to bring out the flavour.

1063
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,799
That looks good. It looks
tempting, I want to eat it.

1064
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
When you get that bresaola,

1065
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,799
it's delicious, cos the texture is spot-on

1066
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,799
and the flavours are coming
through beautifully.

1067
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,799
But you haven't driven it
together as one centrepiece -

1068
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,799
what you've got is three loaves
and sort of come up with a story,

1069
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,799
that, yeah, it comes
together as a centrepiece.

1070
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Which doesn't really wash with me!

1071
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
How do you think it went?
Yiamas, by the way. Thank you.

1072
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,799
Um, it went all right, I think.

1073
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,799
LAUGHTER

1074
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,799
Brace, brace(!)

1075
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,799
Are you bribing the judges?
No! I'll have it after.

1076
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,799
Do you want a little sip of this,
before I tell you what I think?

1077
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,799
LAUGHTER Oh! Oh!

1078
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,799
It is a mess.

1079
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,799
They are sort of folded over,

1080
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
but not properly plaited.

1081
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,799
Olive, coriander and onion
is a classic. Yeah.

1082
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,799
But you've mixed it with other
flours and diluted it and

1083
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,799
you need more coriander in there. OK.

1084
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,799
It's rather sad you didn't glaze
it, we didn't get the rise and we

1085
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,800
haven't got the definition of the plaiting.

1086
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,799
You've done really well to keep
the plaiting so well contained.

1087
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,800
The overall effect on it is
superb, it is very, very good.

1088
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,799
The textures and flavours in each of
the layers are absolutely gorgeous.

1089
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,799
Especially in the focaccia with
the onion in it, it's beautiful.

1090
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,799
The goat's cheese works
exceptionally well in there.

1091
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,800
That is a fantastic loaf.

1092
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,799
I think you should be congratulated

1093
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,800
and I want to come on your next picnic!
You're welcome!

1094
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,799
We asked for plaits in both, we've
got a plait in your lower loaf,

1095
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,799
but the one above, it's
all gone into one. Yes.

1096
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,799
You can look at the dark rye,
how much it's broken up,

1097
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
and the light rye, too.

1098
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:38,800
Just work those doughs a little bit more.

1099
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,799
It's quite close textured. Yes.

1100
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,799
I can't SEE the green olives, I
can't TASTE the green olives,

1101
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,799
I can't SMELL the green
olives and mozzarella,

1102
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I haven't hit any of them.

1103
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:57,799
The twist on the bottom is very good
and it tastes lovely. Thank you.

1104
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,799
Really good. The top one is a mess, though,

1105
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
and when it comes to flavour,

1106
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:04,799
dough development,
plaiting, proving, baking.

1107
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
I mean, all of it.

1108
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
Ta-dah, everybody(!)

1109
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,799
MEL: So who's going to be crowned
Star Baker, Paul and Mary?

1110
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,799
If it was just today's performance,
it would have been Kate.

1111
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,799
It certainly could be Tom.

1112
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,799
And it could be Andrew.

1113
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,799
The people who are a little
bit in trouble is Val... No!

1114
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,799
Although she did come first in Technical,

1115
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,799
she was poor in the Signature
and today wasn't good.

1116
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,799
I think Michael is in a little bit
of trouble as well and Candice,

1117
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,799
as well. Last week's Star Baker.
The curse of the Star Baker.

1118
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,799
Keep talking about it as
if it's a real thing.

1119
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,799
(The curse of the Star Baker.) The
curse of the Star Baker. Ooh!

1120
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
BIRDSONG

1121
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,799
Bakers, I get the great job.

1122
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,799
I get to announce who's
this week's Star Baker.

1123
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,799
There were many great bakes
in the Showstopper round,

1124
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,799
but this was the stuff of legend.

1125
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,799
A sight for Thor eyes.

1126
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,799
Yes, it's Hammertime.

1127
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,799
Congratulations, Tom.

1128
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,800
You're Star Baker! Well done, Tom!

1129
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,799
On this racecourse of bakery,

1130
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,799
you are all thorough-breads.

1131
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
But I'm so sorry, you
know how this works...

1132
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,799
So I'm afraid the person...

1133
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,799
(Oh, it's going to be me.) ..who
will not be joining us next time

1134
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
on Bake Off is...

1135
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,799
..Michael.

1136
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,799
I'm really sorry, Michael.
So sorry to say goodbye.

1137
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
You're such a good 'un.

1138
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,799
The bake I went on is a bake
that meant a lot to me,

1139
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,800
so, yeah, it is quite sad that I
went based on that. So sorry.

1140
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,799
Going to be letting my mum know first.

1141
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,799
She's been the one with
me right from the start.

1142
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
She'll still be proud of me.

1143
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Happy I've got this far,

1144
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:12,799
but obviously I just wasn't
sort of up to the standard.

1145
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,799
I'd like to see Michael carry
on doing what he's doing.

1146
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,799
He is a great baker, actually,
he's a nice lad as well.

1147
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,799
I'm sorry, my friend.

1148
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
I said I'll keep in touch with him.

1149
00:56:20,801 --> 00:56:23,799
We'll meet in Cyprus and have a beer.
Certainly not a zivania!

1150
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,799
I'm one very lucky lady again.

1151
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,799
Next week I need to have a little
sort of rethink and really

1152
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,799
learn, because I don't want
to feel like this again.

1153
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,799
I think you were a bit shocked about that!
I was REALLY shocked!

1154
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,799
Tom has been consistently in the
middle or slightly above, but

1155
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,799
he pulled out the stops this week
and I was very pleased to see it.

1156
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,799
I did not expect that. At all. In any way.

1157
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,799
I was looking around thinking,

1158
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,799
"Did they make a pun about Thor's Hammer?"

1159
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,799
(Star Baker!)

1160
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,799
Obviously, it would have
been nice to get Star Baker,

1161
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,799
but to be fair, thoroughly
deserved by Tom today.

1162
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,799
My corn doll lucky charm is
coming back next week, actually!

1163
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,800
I think she might become my baking mascot!

1164
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,799
I'm hanging in by the skin of my teeth.

1165
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,799
I've got to work on timing, consistency,

1166
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,799
and the challenge next week -

1167
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,799
my goodness, it is a challenge.

1168
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,799
Next time...

1169
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,799
For the first time in the history
of Bake Off... Hot oil...

1170
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,799
It's batter week. All the
colour has drained from you.

1171
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,799
But who can make identical
Yorkshire puddings?

1172
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,799
They're not going to allow me into
Yorkshire ever again. And fill them?

1173
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,799
Unbelievable. Who can flip a
technically perfect pancake?

1174
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Yeah!

1175
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:34,799
And who can produce a Showstopper...
I am done.

1176
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,799
..without an oven?

1177
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Hopefully!
