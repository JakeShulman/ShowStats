1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, we're all ready, we've got whisky...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Skewery things. Sievey. Spatulisations. That sort of thing.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's that down there? Oh, that's from home, don't touch it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't know why that's there, sorry. We're missing something.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are we missing? WOMAN CLEARS THROAT

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh. Oh.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
BOTH: Welcome to a brand-new series of The Great British Bake Off.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When you think of how many people have applied... Why me?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Coming down the drive, you could just see the tips of the tent,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and I thought, "My goodness, it's real, it's there!"

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Scary. It's like walking into school the first time.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a little bit like going in for an exam.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I feel like I'm going for an exam.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Last night I was having some pretty crazy dreams about cakes chasing me.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Getting the coveted Hollywood handshake would be incredible.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so excited to meet Mary,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
because I quite want to ask her to be my nan a little bit.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Which of these 12 new bakers...

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When an athlete enters a race,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
they don't hope to finish third or fourth, they want to be the winner.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
..can master 30 brand-new challenges?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have cried over cake.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have shouted at a pie. I think I'm too laid-back.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In 2016, who will win The Great British Bake Off?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think I was about to give birth the last time I felt this nervous.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We've returned to the beautiful grounds of Welford Park in Berkshire

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for a star-studded start to this year's Bake Off.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, I've got Kate Moss, Cate Blanchett,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Kate Middleton, Kate Bush

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and also Kate Garraway. Can I just stop you there?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you mishear my voicemail message? I said it's cake week.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Not Kate. Cake. Oh.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Over the next two days,

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the bakers will tackle the first three challenges.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
After which, one of them will be crowned Star Baker

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and one will have to leave the Bake Off tent.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Bakers, welcome to the marquee of madness

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and your very first Signature Challenge.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We would love you to make a drizzle cake.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The keyword for this challenge, ladies and gentlemen, is -

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and it's my favourite word - moist.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We want sumptuous drizzling, please.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I don't want to add extra presh onto you at this stage,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
it is Paul's favourite cake. Presh.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You've got two hours to achieve ultimate moistness. On your marks...

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get set. Bake!

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Scissors, scissors. I can't believe I'm here at all.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's just so exciting.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm speaking for myself, nerves are kicking in,

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but I don't know what other people are like.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are they shaking?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My hands are fairly steady, so, yeah, all good to go, I think.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Over the years, our challenges have got a little bit more difficult.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And what we want to do is take it back to basics...a little bit,

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but that doesn't mean the judging is going to get easier.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In fact, it's going to get harder.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The classic drizzle cake is a lemon drizzle cake.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I want them to be really much more inventive.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
12 new bakers.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm expecting the unexpected.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Can you give me some help? I can't get the lid off.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can somebody...? Oh, I've got it, I've got it. I've got it, Paul.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
SHE LAUGHS Hello, Val, how are you? I'm fine, thank you.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can you tell us all about your cake, please?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm making orange and lemon drizzle cake.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It won't be sickly, it'll be a tangy cake.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nice to see margarine being brought out as well. Yeah.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My nan used to use margarine all the time. It makes a good cake.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Val lives in Somerset.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She's a retired headmistress, grandmother,

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
keep-fit fanatic and Ed Sheeran fan.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Her mum taught her to bake

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
a classic orange and lemon drizzle cake 50 years ago.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're doing it in two tins.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you getting the drizzle in both of them or just on the top?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm getting it in both of them.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Double drizzle, Val. Always. Double, double drizzle.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nice, rich flavour all the way through the cake.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Val's not the only one starting with a classic.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A lemon drizzle was the first cake I made

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
when I was at university, so it's stayed a favourite.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But one baker is giving theirs a bit of a kick.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's an orange liqueur and lemonade drizzle cake.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's my mum's favourite tipple at Christmas time - Cointreau and lemonade.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Louise is a hair stylist and lives and works in Cardiff.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Those roots.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Her mum's favourite Christmas tipple will soak through

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a drizzle cake in the shape of an orange.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When you've got those two together,

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
are you putting the drizzle on the bottom one AND the top one?

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was going to put the drizzle through the middle,

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
then pour it all around the cake.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hang on. Is this a drizzle or an icing?

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've used Cointreau instead of water, it's water icing.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think for me, I just want to see the moisture soaking into the cake,

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
rather than just sitting on the top.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OK, so not too thick?

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good luck. Too thick. Thank you. OK.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think he knows what he's talking about, doesn't he?

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's a professional.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
One classic drizzle cake hasn't had the best of starts.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's coming to a bit of a clump at the moment.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was a bit firmer than I wanted, really, the butter.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Lee is a church minister from Bolton.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But his inspiration for his lemon and orange drizzle cake

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
hails from a little further south.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My grandparents originally came from just a few miles away,

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
from St Clements, so they would have heard the bells.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So my cake is based on the bells.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, you've got a little bit of separation there.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It just cuts down the rise a bit. Yes. We'll wait and see.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MEL: Don't worry, Lee. Don't worry. You're fine. Good luck.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I did have a moment where I panicked and cut myself

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
within 30 seconds of us starting.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Still Zen. We'll see how long that lasts.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
One of the bakers' first worries

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
is the consistency of their drizzle cake batter.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm happy now, I've got some cake for company.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, not quite cake, but we're getting there.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They'll need to produce a sponge firm enough to hold

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the drizzled syrup, but still light enough to melt in the mouth.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A little bit more technical than I'm used to.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Success relies on the perfect ratio of wet to dry ingredients.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's black treacle, golden syrup, honey, brown sugar and butter,

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so it's probably not for someone who's on a diet.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
With his family in North London, Michael is studying economics

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
300 miles away at Durham University.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
At 19, he is this year's youngest baker.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
His ginger and lime drizzle cake is a reminder of home.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's like an alternative we had at Christmas time for Christmas cake.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not the most difficult cake,

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it's just a lot of ingredients to get into the cake at once.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you know how long we've had? No.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Selasi is risking adding an ingredient not often found in a drizzle cake.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What I've done is heated the cardamom.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to grind them and put them in my mix.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Born in Ghana, and now living and biking in London,

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Selasi works in the City.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
To balance the cardamom, he's adding cinnamon to his citrus drizzle cake.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Selasi, how's it going? I like to think I'm OK with drizzle cakes.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hopefully I don't mess it up.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Bit if all else, quite frenetic, it's a competition,

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and there you are just serenely pottering around. Yeah.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's it, I just enjoy it. What's your day job?

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I work in client services for a financial institution.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, banking kind of? It can be demanding.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Obviously in a moment's notice something could go really bad

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and everyone's... Like a global financial collapse.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
SHE LAUGHS

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. See, everybody. Global financial collapse.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In a bid for maximum moistness...

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
..two bakers are risking adding

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
fresh fruit straight in with their finished batters.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
My tin's got dimples in the bottom,

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so I'm layering slices of apples into the bottom of the tin,

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
which will eventually become the top of my cake.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They're a nice, firm, crisp apple, and they're quite tart,

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so I like the flavour of a Cox. They're a good old-fashioned English apple.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Kate gets her seasonal fruit from her family farm in Norfolk,

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
picked by her daughters, Lucy and Rebecca.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's enough, let's put the flour on the table, please,

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you horrible children.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Once her apple and vanilla sponge is baked,

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
she'll drizzle it with blackberry syrup.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
My kids picked the blackberries, so I'm putting them to good use,

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the few that I managed to save,

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that they hadn't eaten as they picked.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I love rhubarb and anything that makes me go...

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like a bit tart, so, yeah.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Candice is a PE teacher and works in Bedford.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She has a healthy twist to her rhubarb and lime drizzle cake.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a gluten-free, so it's a mix of ground pistachios,

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
ground almonds and polenta.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then I'm also going to insert some custard,

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
so it's sort of like a rhubarb, custard kind of drizzle.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How's the custard getting in there, then?

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm going to poke it in, Mary.

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
CANDICE LAUGHS

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I love pistachios, I just love the colour.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I love lemon drizzle, but I thought I wanted to mix it up

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
a little bit, so I've got some green stuff in there.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Benjamina lives in South London with her mum,

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
younger brother Nathan and twin sister Benita.

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's taking too long.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They all fight over slices of her pistachio and lemon drizzle cake.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It looks how it has looked at home, so that's good.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't think they can't see you just because you're at the back. I know.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I feel like I'm hiding. Yeah. No hiding here.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's so true. Stick it in.

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All the effort to make a batter with the perfect consistency

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is now at risk of unravelling.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, it looked like at home, so that's hopeful.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The wrong temperature...

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the wrong baking time...

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
..and no amount of drizzling...

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I said a prayer.

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
..can save their cake.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Can't change it now.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you know what I've done? I've left my ground almonds out.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And I'm using it as part of the flour.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Jane is a garden designer who lives in Kent

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
with her husband, Ray, and two children, Henry and Amy.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I could eat a whole Pavlova at once. The glory days.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
She's been making her lemon and poppy seed drizzle cake

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
since Amy and Henry were little.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm having a terrible morning.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why, what's happened? I've left all my ground almonds out.

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The almonds kind of stays moist

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
without it just changing the proportions of the cake,

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
so I started again. Have you got time now?

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's going to be a bit of a squeeze. It's going to be a bit tight, but...

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
OK. Good luck. Look forward to it. Thank you very much.

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OK, bakers, that's one hour to make your drizz the shiz. One hour!

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I forgot to put cinnamon. I'm going to have to make it again.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The whole cake? No, Selasi!

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to get it in the oven and then panic.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can you not just add it to the syrup? Hmm.

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They seem to be rising.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In the precious minutes whilst their sponges are baking,

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
hoping to deliver even more moisture...

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Move a little, lose a lot.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
..some bakers have given themselves an extra challenge of making a filling.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm just making the tonic curd for my gin and tonic drizzle cake.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
MEL GASPS

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Tom is from Rochdale. He's a project manager and fearless free climber.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He's risking three shots of gin for his G drizzle cake.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So there's going to be a layer of tonic curd

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then a gin drizzle on the top. Mary is quite partial to gin,

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but I think you're going to have to get the flavour coming through.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
How are you getting the flavour in there?

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So, this is a litre of tonic water that I'm boiling down,

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that'll flavour the curd at the end. It's an intense flavour.

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You either will like this curd or you really won't like this curd.

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
35.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's gone really...domey.

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But in, second time, so...

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
fingers crossed.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I missed out the cinnamon in the cake,

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
so I think I'll just use the cinnamon in the syrup.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's what baking is about, improvising, right?

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The bakers now face a crucial decision.

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right, I'm going in.

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If their sponges are even slightly underbaked...

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No.

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
..they could disintegrate when soaked with drizzle.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Might just give it five minutes.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That'll give me time to stir my custard.

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I listen to my cakes, and they're not ready.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
They sing. And they say, "Not ready, not ready!"

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Overbaked sponges will be too tough

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and the drizzle won't penetrate deep enough.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I might just give it a minute. Yeah.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm happy with that.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They look lovely. They do look nice, don't they? They do.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And so beautifully presented. Exactly.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think I should just leave them like that.

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They're the sort of page three of drizzle. Yes, they are, aren't they?

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Still wobbly.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm happy with that. I've just got to get my drizzle ready.

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Drizzle is usually a careful combination of sugar syrup and fresh fruit.

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Squeezing my blackberries through a jelly net.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Looks like I'm doing some kind of awful medical procedure.

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sorry, blackberries.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But the classic combinations...

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's have some gin first. That's the really fun bit.

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
..don't suit everyone.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am making a ginger spice yuzu drizzle cake.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Drizzle is the yuzu juice and some demerara sugar.

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've never heard of yuzu. Really? What's it like?

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think it's a bit of a cross between a lemon and a lime. Nice.

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Rav is a support worker and lives in Erith, Kent,

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
with his dad, Manjit, mum, Beant,

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
his big sister, Sat, and her husband Sanj.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
His ginger sponge topped with crystallised stem ginger

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
will be soaked with Japanese yuzu fruit drizzle.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Have you prepared your drizzle?

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm trying to infuse mine

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and the rosemary gives it a slightly different twist.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Andrew's from Northern Ireland, but now lives in Derby

282
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and works as an aerospace engineer.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He has a precise method to soak drizzle

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
into his rosemary and lemon sponge.

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Just hold in the cocktail stick at half length, the idea being

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll get an even distribution of drizzle through the sponge.

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hopefully, it will give me an edge.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's enough holes.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
By poking holes in the top, when the drizzle gets poured on,

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
it's going to seep down those holes, escaping to the cake itself.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I want to do it while it's still warm

292
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and give it time to soak through.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's going to be very moist.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It just needs to cool a bit before I put the drizzle on it.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It wants to be warm but not hot.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Otherwise, the drizzle will go straight through

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and out the other side.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Aerobic exercise for the day.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Calm has been restored.

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I want to do this quite slowly so that the drizzle absorbs

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
rather than run straight down my little grooves.

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How long have we got? Ten minutes?

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
About that, I think.

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OK, bakers, ten minutes on the drizzle,

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or wet cake as we call it in Croydon.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Drenched.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm going to decorate my cake with primroses.

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They're all edible.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This is orange and icing sugar.

310
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want it thick enough to slide down the side of the cake

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but not so thick that it will slide off.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is a thinner icing than I planned to do.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh! Disaster.

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Could get away with it.

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That is time, ladies and gentlemen.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Move your bakes to the end of the benches.

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Bakes to the end.

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Move your purple ring where I can see it, Kate.

319
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everyone else's is insane.

320
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It resembles an orange.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The bakers are about to face the judgment of Mary and Paul

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
for the very first time.

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're the first. Yep.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Now, when I look just here,

325
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm wondering whether that was quite done.

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm going to taste from there

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because either it is the syrup going down

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or it's not quite baked there, I'm not sure.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That is fully baked, but I was just wondering.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's a great flavour, great texture

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and it does melt in the mouth as well.

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Well done. Thank you. Top draw.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I arrived just as you were mixing it

334
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and you did have a total separation

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
when you creamed the butter and sugar together

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and that's why we've got quite an open texture.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The flavour's good...

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
texture's awful.

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can't get the drizzle, but I get a very, very good ginger cake. OK.

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If we'd said, "Can we have a ginger cake?"

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you'd be top of the table. Yeah.

342
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm trying to find the blackberry, I'm not getting much of it.

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a shame, I expected better flavours. It's disappointing.

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When you put your drizzle on,

345
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
did you put it on both cakes? I didn't.

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can see straight away where the drizzle has gone.

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The drizzle has basically reached the curd in the middle

348
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
but I'll tell you what, that sponge feels good.

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Cor!

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well...

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't feel my face any more.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This has got no flavour. It's just been killed off by the alcohol.

354
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank goodness we haven't got any at the bottom as well

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
or we wouldn't be able to tell the tale.

356
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Fascinating that it's gluten free.

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It isn't a cake, it is like a pudding.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It is like a steamed pudding, but that is delicious. Yes!

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The flavour is really beautiful.

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The spices are not coming through in the cake.

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think it's the yuzu that we're tasting.

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's neither lime nor lemon, so I'm trying to identify what it is.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
My brain's going, "What is that?" Watch your flavours. OK.

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's definitely strong rosemary, but not overpowering.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's not enough lemon. Oh, really?

366
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you're going to put lemon in there, put lemon in there.

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I could take more orange than that. My problem is it's very dense.

368
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, I could just wring that out like a flannel. Yeah.

369
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We've ended up with a bit of a messy-looking cake.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That looks a good sponge to me, but the drizzle, we'll wait and see.

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Where's the drizzle?

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's very dry.

373
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, he's taking an awful long time. Don't leave us hanging, Pauly.

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The flavours are fantastic. Thank you. I love the flavours.

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You made a mistake, forgetting an ingredient in the cake

376
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
but you quickly thought, "I'll pop it in the drizzle."

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I think, gosh, that drizzle syrup is good. Thanks. Thank you.

378
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Jane, lovely to see a smile on your face.

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You were facing disaster when we last spoke to you.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But it looks good when you cut it. It all looks very tempting.

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Beautiful lemon flavour coming through. Thank you.

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Poppy seed, I love poppy seeds. One of my favourite things in the world.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You've got great penetration there

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
of the syrup running all the way through.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then the icing sets it off.

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's a very, very good drizzle. Well done. Thank you so much.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That was a drizzle cake.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You're filled with self-doubt

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and the thrill when they like it is just unbelievable.

390
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think I did a little... That's amazing.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know when Paul gives you that look.

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But it was good, so, yeah, can't complain.

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Too much icing, not enough drizzle.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You can't turn the clock back now, it's...

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We can only move on.

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The bakers were able to practise for their first challenge.

397
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But the second has been kept in gingham-clad secret.

398
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Welcome to this first technical challenge, set for you today

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
by the Queen of technical challenges herself, Ms Mary Berry.

400
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Mary, any words of advice?

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's suggested that you do things in an order. Keep to that order.

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Short but sweet. Now, Paul, off to the soft play area.

403
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't injure yourself on the balls.

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm very excited about this.

405
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Mary would like you to make 12 Jaffa cakes. Yes!

406
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What we're looking for is whipped, fatless sponges,

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
orange jelly and slathered in chocolate. Oh!

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You've got two hours. On your marks. Get set. BOTH: Bake

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
All the bakers have identical ingredients

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and a basic version of Mary's recipe.

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's very ambiguous. You've got to really read it and think, "Hmm."

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You never take much notice of one when you're eating it.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I know what it's meant to look like.

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hopefully, it doesn't turn out like that.

415
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I've never made Jaffa cakes before.

416
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Mary, why have you chosen Jaffa cakes

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
as their first technical challenge?

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They're a great British classic.

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
First of all, they've got to make a whisked sponge,

420
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
but very precisely.

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If they do it too high, there'll be no room for the lovely jelly.

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If it's too low, you won't have that lovely top to it.

423
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sponge - beautiful and light.

424
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Nice line of jelly and then you've got that chocolate on the top.

425
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We do not want the chocolate running down the side.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's got to be absolutely perfect.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, that's a Jaffa cake right there.

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We don't do that in the South, you know.

429
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It literally just says, "Make a jelly."

430
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Just boiled the water, it says zest of one orange.

431
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hmm, it needs fresh orange.

432
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Er...let's put that down.

433
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, I'm happy with that.

434
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's your first technical challenge, how can you be so calm?

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think I've got a problem.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you actually doing anything? Yes.

437
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm leaking a bit here.

438
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
In the fridge.

439
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It says make a sponge.

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I think what I'm going to do is whisk up the eggs and caster sugar

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and then I think I'm going to fold in the flour.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I think I'm going to do that.

443
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm trying to make them at least triple in size in terms of volume.

444
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't want to over-whisk it either cos it will make the sponge tough.

445
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Ideally, I'd do it over heat to get as much volume into the eggs.

446
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
When you heat up the eggs, they whip up a lot thicker.

447
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's just about there. I'm now folding the flour in.

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What you don't want to do is knock the air out of it.

449
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
"Pour the cake mixture into the bun tin and bake."

450
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It doesn't say how much to put in.

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm trying to make sure I don't put too much.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You don't want too much cake.

453
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
She did say make 12, didn't she?

454
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They're looking pretty full.

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Going to bake this for about eight to ten minutes.

456
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's see if I can...guess the time.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The instructions don't say how long to bake them for.

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So I'm looking for when they go golden brown

459
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and that's the point I want to take them out

460
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so they don't go too far

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
cos then they can be crispy, like ladies' fingers.

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They've got a nice shape, but they've not got enough colour yet.

463
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, those are looking quite high.

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I thought, "I know what a Jaffa cake looks like."

465
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Now I'm beginning to question even what a Jaffa cake looks like.

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's coming out.

467
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They're done.

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Perfect.

469
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, I'm happy with them.

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The sponges are very large.

471
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, you've gone for maxi-Jaffa.

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Big boys. A sort of Jaffa muffin, a sort of Juffin.

473
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I greased them, but obviously not enough,

474
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
so they're sticking a little bit.

475
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I might cut off a bit of that side.

476
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But that could prove to be a rogue strategy.

477
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
How is Mary's recipe looking? Have you stuck to it?

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is there anything you've done differently with it?

479
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Well... Oh, hang on, hang on.

480
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I added a little bit of orange juice to the jelly.

481
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Fresh orange. Does it say add fresh orange juice?

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No, but I was really worried because I added more water, didn't I?

483
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Where did you get the orange juice from? The orange. Oh, I see...

484
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
THEY SNIGGER

485
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Bakers, that's one hour to dip those Jaffa cakes. One hour!

486
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
There's no instructions about what size to cut the jelly.

487
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It just says... "Place the jelly disc onto each sponge."

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know what size to use.

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That one or that one.

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
On memory, I've eaten Jaffa cakes,

491
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm sure they're not the whole size of the actual sponge.

492
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
They're sort of in the centre.

493
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We'll go with the smaller one. Oh, I don't know, the bigger one.

494
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It leaves just a centimetre around the edge, so you're going to get

495
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
that little bump which I think is classic Jaffa cake.

496
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm just going to go big.

497
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know whether to do that way...

498
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
..or the other way.

499
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's more flying saucer

500
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and that's a bit more fried egg, isn't it? Yeah.

501
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And what are you going to go for? I'm not quite sure yet.

502
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Who knows what's the right way round,

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but I'm just going to go for it.

504
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, I think I should be turning them over, you know,

505
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think I was right the first time.

506
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
There seems to be some discussion as to whether the jelly disc

507
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
should go on that side or on that side.

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yep, that side. 100%.

509
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm having one of those epiphanies.

510
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I can make a better job of the chocolate that way round.

511
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The instructions don't actually say how much chocolate to put on.

512
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm controlling the spread. I don't want it dripping down the side.

513
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm trying to get it right to the edges without going over the edge.

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That is a really ugly shape.

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't know whether just turning all the others over

516
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and just have one odd one in there and hope they don't notice.

517
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think I'm the only one that's covering this side.

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I overheard Jane was doing it this way

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and I think she's abandoned ship.

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The doubt is creeping up second by second.

521
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Bakers, I've just heard from Paul's keeper.

522
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He's due to be released in five minutes.

523
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Five minutes, bakers.

524
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Decorate with a classic criss-cross pattern.

525
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't know what the cross looks like. How do you get the ridges?

526
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Cos they got to be ridged, haven't they? I'll do it with a skewer.

527
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Look at it, it's really misshapen.

528
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Oh, no!

529
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Argh!

530
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
He's going to say they're untidy again!

531
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If I put my wonky one in the middle, is it hiding it?

532
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He's got them upside down. Huh?

533
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Put them the other way up. Yeah.

534
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OK, bakers, time is up.

535
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
If you'd like to bring your Jaffa cakes

536
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and pop them behind the photo of yourself on the gingham altar.

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
'Mary and Paul are expecting 12 identical Jaffa cakes

538
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
'with light sponge, set jelly and criss-cross chocolate.

539
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
'As this challenge is judged blind, they have no idea whose is whose.'

540
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
OK, starting with this one. That's a bit of a mess on the top, isn't it?

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But they've made an attempt of the criss-cross.

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That's a nice sponge. Tastes good, yeah.

543
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is quite dull, isn't it, the chocolate?

544
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If the chocolate is dull, it means it's got a little bit too hot.

545
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They are fairly uniform...ly bad.

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
A little bit of a shine, but I couldn't see much jelly in there.

547
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Now, these all seem to be the right way

548
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and then that one's the wrong way.

549
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
We'd like them all uniform.

550
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And there's not much of a mark on the top,

551
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
they've just piped some chocolate onto the top.

552
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The chocolate's not gone to the outside,

553
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
so you end up with a lump of chocolate in the middle.

554
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It doesn't look like a Jaffa cake when you do that. No, it doesn't.

555
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This one's quite neat, actually.

556
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They've almost done feathering on this one. Yeah. The sponge is good.

557
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's a good size. Nice shine on that chocolate.

558
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It holds together well.

559
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The chocolate's quite thin as well on that one. Hm.

560
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
A nice amount of jelly compared with everything else. It's just perfect.

561
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Mm. Good flavour.

562
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now, these are upside down. They are upside down.

563
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's meant to be that way as opposed to that way.

564
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Moving on to the next one,

565
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
this looks quite thick with chocolate, doesn't it?

566
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The actual sponge has risen more at one side than the other.

567
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And what's happened to the bottom? Looks like it's stuck

568
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and they've been trimming them down a little bit.

569
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah, they've been trimming them down the side, look. Oh, it's stuck.

570
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Right, the last one.

571
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
These actually look a bit like proper Jaffa cakes, don't they?

572
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
A really nice shine on this one, neat at the edges

573
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and one of the few that has a THIN layer of chocolate on top.

574
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Mm. They're pretty good. I like them.

575
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
'Paul and Mary will now rank the Jaffa cakes

576
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
'from their technical worst to best.'

577
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
In 12th place is this one. Whose is this?

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It was upside down.

579
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And in 11th place,

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
it's a thick layer of chocolate and it hasn't reached the edge.

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
'Val is tenth, Louise, ninth, Rav, eighth,

582
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
'Jane, seventh, Benjamina, sixth.

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
'Fifth is Candice and Kate is fourth.'

584
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And in third place, these have got a nice shine on them,

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
a nice batch, very even.

586
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In second place...

587
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Well done. Small, dainty, nice bit of chocolate. Good flavour.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Well done.

589
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And in first place...

590
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Well done.

591
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
These look evenly baked,

592
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
they're well finished and they taste jolly good.

593
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well done. Thank you.

594
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
HE EXHALES AND LAUGHS

595
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I-I don't know how that happened.

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I can live with second. I feel like I've clawed back some credibility.

597
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Argh!

598
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, no...

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Not where I wanted to be at this point.

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Tomorrow I'm going to come back and, you know,

601
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
give it some more welly, really.

602
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
'One challenge remains before we discover

603
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
'who will be our first Star Baker

604
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
'and who will be the first to leave the Bake Off tent.'

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Who would you say is in line for Star Baker?

606
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I think that Selasi and Jane are right up there. Possibly Benjamina.

607
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Who might be going? Lee's signature bake, the texture was like a...

608
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It was tough. And Val's had no flavour, actually.

609
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think Louise. Andrew, he was last in technical.

610
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So, today is obviously a big day.

611
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's their first Showstopper Challenge.

612
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
This is their chance to show off.

613
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm doing it nude, that's my contribution.

614
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm going to do it just naked from the waist down.

615
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Morning, bakers. Welcome to your first Showstopper day.

616
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Now, today, Mary and Paul would like you to make a mirror glaze cake.

617
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It should be so shiny that Paul can look into it and say,

618
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
"You're looking gorgeous." SHE PURRS

619
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The sponge should be a genoise and the mirror glaze should cover

620
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
the entirety of the cake. You've got three hours, so...

621
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
On your marks... Get set... BOTH: Bake.

622
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's really important for me to do well today.

623
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Just trying to keep focused and everything will go fine.

624
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm just not looking at the other bakers,

625
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
just pretending like I'm at home.

626
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
A mirror glaze is shiny,

627
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
like a polished, posh car.

628
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The sort of thing that you see in a French patisserie

629
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
with that very high polish and glaze.

630
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm looking for sheer perfection.

631
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If it was me, I would go small and beautiful.

632
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The first Showstopper, their chance to create something

633
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that's going to stick in our minds,

634
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
thinking, "They know what they're doing."

635
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Before this cake, I've never tried to make a mirror glaze.

636
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I wasn't really 100% sure what it was.

637
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Jane needs the juice and zest of five oranges

638
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
for her chocolate orange mirror glaze cake.

639
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm making, in effect, a Jaffa cake cake.

640
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
My Jaffa cake yesterday, I got one upside down and I'm hoping

641
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm going to do a little better today, at least the right way up.

642
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Good morning. Hi, hi. Louise, tell us about your mirror glaze cake.

643
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's based on a white chocolate trifle,

644
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
so I've incorporated all the flavours from that.

645
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Louise's cake will be filled with raspberry creme patissiere

646
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and covered with white chocolate buttercream and mirror glaze.

647
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So, you're having the sponge at the bottom,

648
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
where you're cutting it, filling it... Yes.

649
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
..then putting buttercream on the outside?

650
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm putting the buttercream on the outside,

651
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
cos a white chocolate glaze is very unforgiving. Hmm.

652
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
OK.

653
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank you.

654
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The bakers must make a genoise, an incredibly light, fatless sponge.

655
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
This can only be achieved by whipping air into eggs and sugar

656
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and keeping it there.

657
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Even when they add their dry ingredients.

658
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't enjoy making it.

659
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's a little bit temperamental, if I'm honest.

660
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The secret to a good genoise is,

661
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
you want your eggs really whipped up,

662
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
because that's where all the raising comes from.

663
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's no baking powder.

664
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Benjamina will fill her genoise

665
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
with salted praline Swiss meringue buttercream.

666
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Her minimalist cake will be finished with a white chocolate mirror glaze.

667
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a little bit sophisticated, so I think it'll go down well.

668
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A pan of just barely simmering water.

669
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I don't know what it does to it, but it helps the rise.

670
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't understand it, I'm just baking it.

671
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Selasi is making a vanilla genoise,

672
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
which he'll fill with a set raspberry Bavarian cream

673
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and his cake will be coated in a raspberry mirror glaze.

674
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I do need to add my vanilla seeds, which I've forgotten to add.

675
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This is sort of like a habit,

676
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
just forgetting to put stuff into recipes.

677
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I think it will all be riding on the sponge today.

678
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What I'm going to do now is mix in the butter

679
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
before folding in the flour.

680
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I've lost count.

681
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm trying to fold the flour in as gently as I can

682
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
whilst making sure it's properly incorporated.

683
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I've had to practise this one quite a lot.

684
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Andrew's orange genoise will be filled with salted caramel cream

685
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and his chocolate orange mirror glaze will be decorated

686
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
with caramelised hazelnuts.

687
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I wanted to make something quite indulgent.

688
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is a bit of an all-or-nothing bake. If this goes badly, I'm going.

689
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
There will be some deflation of the eggs.

690
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This is the stage where it could go wrong. You just have to be gentle.

691
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Rav's folding in Colombian chocolate for his mocha mirror glaze.

692
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's just the amount that I'm concerned about,

693
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
because I don't want to overpower the chocolate sponge

694
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
with the coffee flavour.

695
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Coffee isn't the only hot beverage available

696
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in the first Showstopper Challenge.

697
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm doing a matcha tea sponge.

698
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Did you say matcha tea sponge? Yeah.

699
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I've never had a matcha tea sponge before, so this will be interesting.

700
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Michael's folding in strong Japanese green tea

701
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
for his matcha mirror glaze cake.

702
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That's going to be one of the most highly caffeinated sponges.

703
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's a sponge that'll wake you up in the morning. I know. It's herbal.

704
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It smells a little like grass. Yeah, it's like a dried grass.

705
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Start.

706
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They're in. Fingers crossed!

707
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
A wing and a prayer.

708
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They're in and hopefully they are good.

709
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Two hours remaining.

710
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, they're not pulling away yet.

711
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm just watching for them pulling away.

712
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Genoise sponges are so light...

713
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh...

714
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
..that the difference between underbaked and overbaked...

715
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, I don't know, it might be ready.

716
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
..could be a matter of seconds.

717
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
If you take them out too soon, then they collapse.

718
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
If you take them out too late...

719
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
then they go really rubbery.

720
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'll say a little prayer!

721
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK, so I'm just going to take my genoise out the oven.

722
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
They look pretty light, so, fingers crossed, they're cooked.

723
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm happy with them. I think they look right.

724
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Mine haven't risen. What am I doing?

725
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
How did I get here when I can't do a sponge?

726
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Candice plans to make a vanilla and chocolate genoise,

727
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
mango and passion fruit jelly,

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
coconut balls,

729
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
chocolate spheres

730
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and a chocolate mirror glaze.

731
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So you've got your two genoise here...

732
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, which are going to go in the bin. Why? Cos they're like rubber.

733
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Did this happen when you practised it at home? Once, yeah.

734
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And they went out the window.

735
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Went literally out the window?

736
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There you go, then. Frisbee. Go on.

737
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Shall I? Knock yourself out, go on. Pyewww!

738
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Passer-by. OK. Good luck. Do you know what, I'll eat that later.

739
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Don't even joke. Listen... You be careful! Pasty.

740
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm starting again.

741
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm panicking...

742
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And Candice isn't alone...

743
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh... No.

744
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What happened to them?

745
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I think I hadn't mixed in the flour properly into the genoise,

746
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
so bits of it were just souffle, and other bits were pancake.

747
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
OK. I know enough to know that's not good.

748
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Guess who didn't put the right amount of sugar in?

749
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Going to have to make a cake again.

750
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
MICHAEL: That's very dense.

751
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Doing the sponges again. I'm starting again.

752
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm going to go again...

753
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That's quite a lot of people starting sponges again, isn't it?

754
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That makes me feel a little bit better!

755
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
90 minutes left in the first Showstopper Challenge.

756
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Right. Take two... Whew!

757
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Definitely think this is a lighter mix.

758
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Cake's going in...

759
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh... Second time lucky...

760
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
(OK...)

761
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
BEEPING

762
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm trying to make some creme pat now.

763
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Might break a little bit of a sweat, but I'll get it done.

764
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I've got my fresh raspberries here which I've pulsed,

765
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and I'm going to sieve it and that's going to go into the Bavarian cream.

766
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This is going to be my jelly. I've added some Seville marmalade,

767
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
because it just gives it a little bit more of an adult flavour.

768
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Also aiming for an adults-only filling...

769
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Tom's hitting the bottle again.

770
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
When I originally wrote this recipe

771
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
it had 200 millilitres of Kirsch in it,

772
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
which is this entire bottle.

773
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
His cherry jam with Kirsch

774
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
will provide the filling for his Black Forest mirror glaze cake.

775
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I've learned a few lessons since yesterday,

776
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
so it now has 15 millilitres of Kirsch in it.

777
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's a new thing for me, learning how to be subtle.

778
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But a subtle approach isn't for everyone.

779
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
On the top of the first one will be a ganache,

780
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
with strawberries laid on top.

781
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then the next sponge will go on

782
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and that will have a strawberry jam on top.

783
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Then another sponge on top with a ganache

784
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and fresh strawberries, and another sponge on top.

785
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It'll be the size of a small European country!

786
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Lee's huge chocolate and strawberry Showstopper

787
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
will be covered in a dark chocolate mirror glaze.

788
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Have you got any cream in it or will it be just ganache and strawberries?

789
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's just the ganache. Do you think I should change it and put...?

790
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I don't think anything, my friend, it's entirely up to you. Yeah!

791
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Thanks.

792
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
For her fillings...

793
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
SHE LAUGHS Green goo.

794
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
..Kate's raided the family farm again.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm doing my gooseberry fool cake,

796
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
filled with a gooseberry fool mousse and a gooseberry gelee.

797
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Her gooseberry Showstopper

798
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
will be decorated with a sky-blue mirror glaze

799
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and two chocolate swallows.

800
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We got married in my parents' barn,

801
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and there was a pair of swallows nesting in the barn.

802
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Swallows remind me of our wedding, so that's why I've chosen it.

803
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh, and I'm completely coordinated with my cake, so I've got

804
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
my swallow dress on and my swallow earrings, I really do like swallows.

805
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Hello, Val. Good morning. Right, what you up to?

806
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm making a frosting. So I've just got to add the icing.

807
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Making sure I get icing sugar rather than flour!

808
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
That'll be handy. Yes.

809
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So, you've got your buttercream here...

810
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Caster sugar, granulated... Am I disturbing you?

811
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No, you're not. And in here you've got which?

812
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Elderberry, rosehip, blackberry, and then lemon juice.

813
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You've got a four-fruits frosting.

814
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
A four-fruits frosting. That's not easy to say!

815
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Val's four-fruit cream cheese frosting

816
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
will fill her chocolate genoise.

817
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And her cake will be covered with a chocolate mirror glaze

818
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and forest fruits.

819
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
When my children were little, we used to go pick blackberries,

820
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and it's the cake we used to make together. Good luck.

821
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Look forward to it. Thank you.

822
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm going to taste this...

823
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's cornflour! Not putting that in.

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They're definitely cooked, these ones.

825
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh... OK.

826
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's all right, that can go on the bottom.

827
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is my second lot of... MOCKING VOICE: ..genoise.

828
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm not happy with them.

829
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ohhhh!

830
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
One hour remaining...

831
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I had a bit of a disaster with my creme pat.

832
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So I'm starting...again.

833
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Before they can add their showstopping mirror glazes...

834
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
the bakers will need to cover their filled sponges

835
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
with a crumb coat of ganache...

836
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's me ganache.

837
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's gone, hasn't it? I can't do anything with it. Oh...

838
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
..or buttercream. Meringue buttercream.

839
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It just split. It looks like scrabbled egg.

840
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Disgusting. Going to do another one.

841
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Could just about have time, I don't know. Maybe.

842
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm a little bit behind now, so I'm having a bit of a 'mare...

843
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
CANDICE: Should I put my jelly in the freezer?

844
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's done, isn't it? Why isn't it setting?

845
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I've literally done everything twice.

846
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It looks like it's a concertina.

847
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The smoother I can get this,

848
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the shinier the glaze will look.

849
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Is this is more stressful than cutting someone's hair, Louise?

850
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yes, I suppose so.

851
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's murder! What do you do when you need to relieve stress?

852
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I usually bake! Oh... That's difficult, then, isn't it? Yeah.

853
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
How's it going, Lee?

854
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I've got to get this in the fridge and chilled for 15 minutes,

855
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
then I can pour the glaze over the top.

856
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, Lee... I think YOU'VE gone a bit glazed.

857
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Please don't split!

858
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's not set.

859
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I need a freezer.

860
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Unless their crumb coat is chilled until it's firm...

861
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, there's one in there.

862
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
..the mirror glaze will melt into it.

863
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Five minutes, I've got to put another layer on.

864
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
..and their Showstopper will be ruined.

865
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh...

866
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Not good, not good, not good.

867
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
30 minutes left on your mirror finish glazes, bakers!

868
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
On reflection...29.

869
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm trying to get my ganache to fill in all the gaps...

870
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That's incredibly neat, Kate.

871
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It needs to go in the freezer. OK, off you go.

872
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You all right, Benjamina?

873
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's so runny!

874
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
SHE SNIFFS

875
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Now, come on...

876
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Breathe.

877
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's just so runny.

878
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It'll be all right.

879
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah? Yeah.

880
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Every second spent crying is a second less... Is wasted.

881
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
..to show how good you are at baking. Yeah?

882
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
OK, Bakers... 15 minutes left of your Showstopper.

883
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm just going to use it however it is.

884
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is for my mirror glaze. I've got water, sugar, cream, cocoa.

885
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Get this mirror glaze on...

886
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Once this is all lovely and smooth, it comes off the heat

887
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and I dissolve some chocolate in it.

888
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Once it gets down to 60 degrees,

889
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
it's cool enough for me to add my gelatine.

890
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I need it to be really quite cool, about 33 to 37 degrees

891
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
before I pour it on, cos otherwise it's going to run straight off.

892
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Still at 40-odd degrees.

893
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
OK. That's bold...

894
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't mind going one shade bluer.

895
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Sure?

896
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
(Oh... Come on.)

897
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
HE EXHALES

898
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, you...Mother Hubbard!

899
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm really nervous to do this!

900
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Bakers, you've got one minute left.

901
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Just got to go on there...

902
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
BLEEP

903
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
What a mess.

904
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Time is up. Move our bakes to the end of your benches.

905
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You did it.

906
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I can't believe I cried!

907
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, mine's...just the worst.

908
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THUNDER RUMBLES

909
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Jane, if you'd like to bring your cake up, thank you.

910
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Jane, tell us about your mirror glaze cake.

911
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It's chocolate and orange cake

912
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
covered in chocolate orange ganache, and then the mirror glaze.

913
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Less is more when it comes to mirror glaze cakes,

914
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and the whole thing looks beautiful.

915
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You have got a good shine,

916
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and you've made the sides beautifully smooth.

917
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I like it. It's a good genoise, good filling,

918
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and it is simple.

919
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Your jelly is gorgeous - set great, and it really sets it off.

920
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's a bit like eating the Technical Challenge again.

921
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's a Jaffa cake, but a very elegant one. Well done.

922
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You've got a smashing shine on your glaze.

923
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
The actual genoise is too dry. Yeah.

924
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You've got the flavour spot on, but the texture's all wrong.

925
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
There's no real flavour, there's nothing lingering in the mouth.

926
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Ironically, you needed more kirsch in it. Mm.

927
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I don't really like flavour. It is grassy, to me. Mm.

928
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It looks as though you have a good-shaped cake underneath,

929
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
but blue is not usually a good colour for icing.

930
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I think it actually looks a bit like penguins on the sea.

931
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I like the flavour of the gooseberries, it's nice and sharp.

932
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You've made a good genoise,

933
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
but the mirror glaze is really letting you down.

934
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Selasi, please bring your cake up.

935
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I have got a vanilla raspberry cream mousse and white chocolate

936
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
mirror glaze cake.

937
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Happy with it? So-and-so.

938
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I think you were very brave to do something

939
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
that nobody else has done, with a fruit glaze,

940
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but it doesn't have a shine on top, which we're expecting.

941
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I love that design, with the fresh raspberries.

942
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I like the clear lines.

943
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That cuts through, it's not dripping down, it's beautifully set.

944
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Um...

945
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'd love to have seen that perfect, that mirror,

946
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but that is simple, it's elegant,

947
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and beautifully flavoured.

948
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Thank you. And it's a joy to eat. Cheers.

949
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You've got a beautiful shine on there.

950
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It looks very appealing.

951
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Is that buttercream inside?

952
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's a kind of buttercream-cum-cream cheese.

953
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It's as though it's been creamed with caster sugar.

954
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That would be classed as a "see me".

955
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
See me later, then!

956
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Sometimes, simplicity is the way forward...

957
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That's taking it a little bit too far.

958
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Your chocolate genoise is too dry.

959
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I can't see the point in having fresh fruit

960
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
just running through the middle, with a very dry ganache.

961
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What it needs is a lift of some cream.

962
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
There is no mirror glaze there, really. No.

963
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's have a look inside.

964
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That is delicious. Really good. Thank you.

965
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Raspberries and cream and creme patissiere,

966
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
all blends well together, it's beautifully moist.

967
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Great inside, terrible outside.

968
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That was a good result. Yeah.

969
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Benjamina, if you'd like to bring your cake up.

970
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You've got a smashing shine on that white chocolate.

971
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You've gone for simplicity, but I think you've executed it well.

972
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Thank you! It looks good.

973
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Looks a pretty good genoise from here.

974
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That's lovely. Really nice.

975
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The praline with white chocolate's always going to be a winner,

976
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
but you've got a beautiful genoise there, as well.

977
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
A true flavour of white chocolate,

978
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and all the flavours and textures go together.

979
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Thank you. Thank you.

980
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Well done!

981
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Candice, if you'd like to bring your cake up.

982
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Candice, tell us all about your cake.

983
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I have made a vanilla genoise,

984
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and in the middle is a chocolate genoise sponge,

985
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and there is a mango and passion fruit jelly,

986
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and the idea is sort of mirror-mirror,

987
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
with the mirror blending into a mirror.

988
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
You have got a lovely shine on your mirror glaze on the top.

989
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
The sides needed a little bit more preparation.

990
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Mm!

991
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Now, that looks an interesting finish to it.

992
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
The plain genoise, it's not quite cooked.

993
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's a very nice flavour, but what's letting this down...

994
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I know. ..is an essential part of this challenge... Yeah.

995
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
..was the genoise. The genoise, yeah.

996
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
If I could have thrown that one, I'd have thrown that one as well!

997
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Well, I don't think you'd be able to throw it,

998
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
cos I think it would bounce back.

999
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I think it looks great, but your plain genoise is awful.

1000
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Sorry.

1001
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It was horrendous.

1002
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You're not going home.

1003
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
They won't do that. You'll be fine.

1004
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Looks excellent. Looks elegant.

1005
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Caramel work's very good, and you've got a nice sheen on there as well.

1006
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It looks stunning, but we want to know what's inside.

1007
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Right...

1008
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Great layers, distinct.

1009
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You can see the salted caramel cream that you've got in there.

1010
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Looks like very soft layers of genoise.

1011
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Mm! All those flavours are a perfect marriage. Absolutely stunning.

1012
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Wow, thank you! Genoise is perfect,

1013
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and the overall look is fantastic and beautifully simple.

1014
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Thank you very much. Well done, Andrew. Well done.

1015
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Thank you very much.

1016
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Well done!

1017
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Mary and Paul must now decide who will be our first Star Baker,

1018
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and who will be the first to be heading home.

1019
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Let's start with a positive. Did anybody really surprise you?

1020
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Andrew. Last in Technical - but that is absolutely beautiful.

1021
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Has that redeemed him? It's certainly redeemed him.

1022
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I thought Jane's had a wonderful mirror glaze.

1023
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I think, when you're looking for Star Baker, Jane is up there.

1024
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think Selasi's up there, as well.

1025
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Benjamina, her Showstopper was delicious.

1026
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Mary, put us out of our misery. Who do you think's in danger?

1027
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
When it comes to down the bottom, Lee's was so dry.

1028
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Val's had an issue - and, dare I say it,

1029
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
people like Candice were doing quite well,

1030
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
then that genoise was not good. The challenges we set,

1031
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you'd look at them and say they're quite simple,

1032
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and that's part of the problem.

1033
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
When it is simple, there's nowhere to hide -

1034
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
you've got to come up with the goods straightaway.

1035
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Simple but fiendish. Yeah. That's how you like it, you two.

1036
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That's how I describe Paul. Yeah. Mm.

1037
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Well done, bakers, one and all -

1038
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you've all worked so incredibly hard.

1039
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I get the nice job this week,

1040
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
cos I get to announce who is going to be the first Star Baker of 2016.

1041
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
This person produces drizzle as fine as a summer holiday in Frinton.

1042
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
This person can also look into the elegant sheen

1043
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
of their beautiful mirror glaze and say to themselves,

1044
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
"Yeah, I'm a pretty skilled baker."

1045
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The Star Baker this week goes to...

1046
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
..Jane. No!

1047
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
APPLAUSE Oh, yes!

1048
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Good for you! Well done, Jane! Well done, Jane!

1049
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Thank you!

1050
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I've got the slightly more onerous task,

1051
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and so it's with real sadness

1052
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
that the person leaving us today is...

1053
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
..Lee. Oh...

1054
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Oh!

1055
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Come on, come on! Come into the Mel-Sue sandwich.

1056
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Oh, well done. Thank you!

1057
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
'I'm disappointed to be the first off,'

1058
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
but I've always enjoyed baking,

1059
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and at church I do baking demonstrations.

1060
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I won't show them a Jaffa.

1061
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I'll buy them a pack.

1062
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Unlucky, my friend. No problem.

1063
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Very sad, but as I've just been saying to him now,

1064
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
"You are one of the 12 best amateur bakers in the country.

1065
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
"You should be very proud of yourself."

1066
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Buck up your ideas. Thank you!

1067
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
'Val was really lucky.'

1068
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
She's really going to have to pull her socks up for the next one.

1069
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I promise I'll dance with you next week!

1070
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
'When I leave here,'

1071
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'll give my husband a call, and say, "I'm through,"

1072
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and he'll probably say, "Well done.

1073
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
"Will I get any tea when you get in?"!

1074
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I don't how I survived that.

1075
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
'Oh, my goodness!'

1076
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Right, come on, Candice - sort yourself out. Smash it next week!

1077
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Please, no more crying!

1078
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Phew!

1079
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I'm in.

1080
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Well, I'm STILL in.

1081
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Well done. Thank you so much.

1082
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Can you believe it?!

1083
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
SHE SIGHS I don't believe it.

1084
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Next time - it's biscuits...

1085
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Louise, breathe.

1086
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
..with a Signature Bake...

1087
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
SHE GASPS

1088
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Ooh... Oh, oh, oh... Disaster.

1089
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
..that's all about the finish.

1090
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress.

1091
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
A twisted Technical Challenge...

1092
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
My mixture is stiff.

1093
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Do you need a pair of warm hands - either on your bag, or on you?

1094
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Um...

1095
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
..and a Showstopper...

1096
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Gosh, I hate gingerbread.

1097
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
..featuring the largest gingerbread structures...

1098
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Fear is the mind-killer.

1099
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
..ever attempted on the Bake Off.

1100
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's going to fall!

1101
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Aah!
