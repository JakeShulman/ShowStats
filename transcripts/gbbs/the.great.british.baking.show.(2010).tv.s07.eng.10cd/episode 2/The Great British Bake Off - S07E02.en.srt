1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to week two in the Bake Off tent.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One baker's gone, they're not coming back,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sue's also gone, but she will be back.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Last week was a piece of cake, now it's crunch time,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but who is going to...snap first?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to The Great British Bake Off.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Last time... The Bake Off began with cakes.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Coming to a bit of a clump at the moment.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What do you do when you need to relieve stress? I usually bake.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I love that design and it's a joy to eat.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Despite Selasi and Andrew's best efforts...

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Absolutely stunning.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
..it was Jane... No! ..who excelled, clinching Star Baker.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you. And although Candice faltered...

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's very rubbery.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
..it was Reverend Lee...

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Texture's awful. ..who became the first baker to leave the tent.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
'This week, it's biscuits.'

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everybody else is ready and I'm not.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They've got to look uniform.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But who can create the crunch...

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now that's crispy.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
..and keep their cool...

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
God, I hate gingerbread. ..when everything around them...

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
SHE GASPS ..is falling apart.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
CONTESTANTS GASP AND GROAN

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who wants to eat some carpet? I'll eat a bit of carpet.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Over the next two days, the bakers will face three challenges

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to test their biscuit-making credentials.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Three chances to claim Star Baker and to avoid leaving the Bake Off.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Morning, bakers. Welcome back to the tent of dreams.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For your Signature Challenge this morning,

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Paul and Mary would like you to make 24 iced biscuits.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They should be identical and the biscuits should be as crisp

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
as Paul Hollywood's hair.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You've got two and a half hours.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
On your marks, get set, BAKE!

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Being Star Baker last week does put a little bit of pressure on.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've made loads and loads of the biscuits,

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but I haven't iced that many, to be honest. I feel good today.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Just have to take each day as it comes and then just bake

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and produce whatever is required.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The trickiest part is not being too ambitious.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
24 biscuits, absolutely perfect, all the same thickness,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
same crunchy texture - it's a really difficult challenge.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You've got to decide whether you want it to snap

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
or be a bit like shortbread.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But biscuits is one of my firm favourites.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I just hope and pray that they give me a mug of tea big enough

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so I can dunk all the biscuits in.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look at the colour of my tea.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wow. That is seriously strong tea.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why is it that colour?

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because I used about, I don't know... 500 teabags?

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah. Good morning, Louise.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hi. Right, can you tell us about your biscuits, please?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Today, I'm making rich tea biscuits with a flavour of bara brith.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can you remind me what is bara brith, Louise?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a Welsh fruitcake.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a very moist loaf and you put lots of butter on it.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When she's not practising for the Bake Off,

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Louise is climbing in the Welsh hills with fiance Simon.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Her flock of sheep-shaped biscuits

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
will contain fruit soaked in tea,

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
bara brith style.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When we bite into it, is it going to break, is it going to crumble,

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is it going to bend? It's not...

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a softer biscuit, it's not too crunchy.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, good luck anyway. Thank you. See you in a bit.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
My biggest challenge today is making sure that I'm not messy

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and that I really work hard on my presentation.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Up until now, Val's harshest critic was one-year-old grandson Arthur.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Too big!

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But it's from her own childhood that Val's drawn inspiration

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
for her shortbreads,

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
resembling Neapolitan ice creams.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When we were kids, we were quite poor.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Things like cornets,

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
we only ever had them as treats if we went to the seaside.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And for years we continued to go on the family holiday

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and Dad always bought us ice creams to make up for the ones

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
he couldn't buy us when we were kids.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Most of the bakers are making biscuit dough by creaming together

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the butter and sugar first...

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I'm looking for a nice crunch

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in the biscuit,

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that's how I'm going to gauge it ultimately, the biscuit,

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
if you get that snap.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
..but Kate, Val and Andrew are relying on rubbing in

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to make their shortbread dough.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My Dad's got legendary shortbread.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He won a women's shortbread

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
competition in the '70s,

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
which is one of his proudest achievements.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When he's not engineering,

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Andrew performs with the local musical theatre group.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He's creating a hive of

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
honey-flavoured shortbread biscuits,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
adorned with iced bees.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's not as snappy a biscuit as some other iced biscuits,

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
it should be like a kind of like an almond shortbread.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Kate's shortbread is a little more fragrant.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've chosen to make a lavender

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and bergamot biscuit.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're using two flavours I'm not particularly fond of.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Smells a bit medicinal to me. Thanks, Bez.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Slightly skincare.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Back home in Norfolk...

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Put your woggle on. ..Kate's a Brownie leader.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She's making shortbreads in the image of swallowtail butterflies

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and she has her own secret

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ingredient for biscuit success.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to be a happy baker, cos then I'll have happy biscuits.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm making my spiced Chai Frappelattecino Biscuits.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm putting quite a lot of spice into these biscuits

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and coffee as well.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tom loves experimenting with novel ingredients and intense flavours.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's made 300 practice biscuits

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to master his blend of four spices

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and ground coffee

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
for a biscuit with a kick.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm not worried that it's going to be too much flavour.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If anything, I'm worried that I'll lose flavour.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Selasi is also hoping his flavours leave a lasting impression.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've blended some Scotch bonnets. Wow. Sorry.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, how is this being flavoured?

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To your tolerance level or to mine and Mary's?

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
To yours.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Selasi has three hobbies - baking,

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
basketball, and his signature biscuits are in the shape

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
of his third - motorbiking.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I've tried it at home

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and the feedback has been good.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Just saying it's the right amount of kick, so hopefully...

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
..I haven't added too much today.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just a little bit...wet.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But I can always just roll in a bit more sugar.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How's it going?

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, it's going all right. On time-ish.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to be a bit like your mum now, Michael, and say I need,

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry, but there's loads of flour in your ear.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Have you cleaned your ears, Michael? I have cleaned my ears, don't worry.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OK, good. My mum made me clean them before I came. Yeah, good.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Our youngest baker, Michael, captains his university hockey team,

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
but it's his other favourite

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
student pastime that's inspired

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
his pint-shaped biscuits.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm trying to ensure that all of the biscuits

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
are the same sort of height.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This challenge could be won or lost over the next few minutes.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know how people get them all the same thickness.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Guided rolling pin, gives me a uniform kind of thickness of dough.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Their dough needs to be rolled thin enough

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to create a good biscuit snap,

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but thick enough to hold their shape.

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm using a school ruler as my guide.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm trying to get to the thickness of a pound coin

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and then we should get a nice snap on it.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think I could make them a bit thinner.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There. I don't want them too thin,

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because there's going to be so much icing on them,

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you do need a good ratio of biscuit to icing.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If not, it's just all sugar.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Teaching Assistant Benjamina likes to be on trend

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
with her baking style.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She's icing a delicate bouquet of flowers

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
onto her chocolate

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and orange biscuits.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They look like chicken drumsticks, but when they're iced,

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
they do actually look like flowers.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Doing some little flowerpot biscuits.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I work in the garden, so it kind of seemed like the thing to do.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jane is hoping her artistic skills as a garden designer

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
will give her the edge when icing

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
her almond-flavour flowerpot biscuits.

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
These are going to be iced. How are you going to do that?

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, I'm going to do all the outlining in purple. Mm.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then flood the different sections.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's a lot of work for the time that you've got,

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I hope you get it all finished.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop talking to her then! Fingers crossed. Good luck.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We need to stop talking to you. Thank you! Thank you, Jane.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So I've gone for little hexagons,

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
which will hopefully tessellate together quite nicely.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It just means any kind of shapes or patterns that fit together,

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
without any gaps. You want them all to look fairly consistent.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My shape is very intricate. It's taken me a long while to cut out.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Show me your home-made cutter, please, Rav. Um...

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Show it to me.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's very, very... It's effective.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Rav's travelled all over the world,

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but it was his recent trip to Goa

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that's inspired his coconut and lime flavoured bunting biscuits.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm now putting my biscuits into the oven.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
With only one oven and 24 biscuits to bake, time is of the essence.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Six minutes, then twist. I'll bake them for about 15 minutes.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think I'm a little bit concerned, there's quite a lot to get done.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the decorating that takes the time.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've only got eight done so far.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
First batch in.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SHE GASPS

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, Louise, are you all right? Yeah.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sure? Yes.

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Take a big, deep breath. Thank you, darling.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So I'll just start again.

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hopefully, I've got enough mixture.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I just need to crack on now.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
OK, bakers, an hour has gone.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, my goodness.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You have an hour and a half left.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Going in. To achieve biscuit perfection...

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come on, bake, bake, bake.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
..the bakers must have an even bake across all their biscuits...

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
..with a consistent texture and colour.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They're nice, crumbly biscuits, so I don't want to break them.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm happy with these, they look like they're baked well.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Slightly brown on the edges...

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I did actually make one extra, so I can get rid of that.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is that allowed?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, I did it anyway. OK, I won't tell.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Please don't. Please don't. Paul and Mary, sorry...

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No, no, no, come back!

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Creating 24 identical biscuits is a mission,

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
but Candice has doubled her workload.

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've got to make 48,

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
24 bases and 24 tops.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It wouldn't be me if I hadn't made things just slightly difficult.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Candice has two major loves in her life - baking and her pug Dennis,

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but he's not allowed anywhere near

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
her double-layered heart biscuits, filled with salted caramel.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now, I need to ask you something. Yes? For each Bake Off you are in,

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
are you going to have a different shade of lipstick?

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you know what, Mel, for you, I am. I am. Come on.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm loving the pink this week.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you, I quite like this one as well.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So if you get through to Bread Week, what colour can we expect?

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I might go red. Nice.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Red for bread. Red for bread. Yes!

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Boom. Got it.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
As well as ensuring an even bake on their next batch...

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Timing is going to be tight on these.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
..the bakers must start icing their first.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's not tricky to do, it's just a bit time-consuming.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I've got, I think, 40 done now,

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
so I'm just going to do another tray. Here we go.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Everybody else is ready and I'm not.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've broken a couple trying to push them out.

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I didn't really do a timed batch at home, which...

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
..in hindsight, was a real error.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Disaster. Uh-uh-uh-uh-oh.

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Whether I can serve these, I'm not sure.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Have you iced any of them, Val? No!

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I haven't. OK, so you've got

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
under half an hour to go.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, what a nightmare.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Not enough time, not enough time.

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is it better to get some of them done fully

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and then some of them empty

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
or is it better to get all of them done partly?

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know. What do you think?

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They've got to look uniform.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
13, 14, 15, 16. One, two, three, four.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know how many I've done.

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
18, 19.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
SHE GASPS

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Not going to do it.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
OK, bakers. We sing, you sing, icing...

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
# Ten minutes to go! #

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Louise, breathe. Sorry? Breathe.

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
SHE EXHALES

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
My hands are shaking.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I've just got to finish flooding these.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As long as you sandwich them together and get them on a plate.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, that's what I want.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's fair to say that this is going to be a messy batch.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
(You can do this.)

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
SHE GASPS

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, it's hurting my back.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hopefully, they all look as near to identical as I can.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Ice creams are meant to be identical anyway.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So that's two minutes left on your icing. Two minutes left!

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is that to get them on your plate as well?

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
These are not high-end of the market.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can you move that for me, please, love? Just fit this in.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just hold it for me a second.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Chaos.

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress, don't stress,

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
don't stress, don't stress, don't stress.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, mine are horrendous.

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We're going to have 24 iced biscuits.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is an embarrassment.

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Never mind. Just ran out of time.

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OK, bakers. The bake is now finished.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Please put your biscuits at the end of your benches.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Everyone stop now, please.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Mary and Paul are looking for 24 identical biscuits,

300
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
beautifully iced with well-balanced flavours.

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hello, Michael. Hi there.

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Right. They're uniform.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And you seem to have a decent bake all the way through.

304
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They look very good. We need to taste them.

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Now, that's crispy. You get the chocolate in there as well.

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And you can see the consistency inside,

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
you can hear it, it's solid.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well done. Thank you very much. Well done. Thank you.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hang on, I haven't finished yet. HE CHUCKLES

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The icing's lovely, but when you get into the actual biscuit, it's soft.

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
OK. What we're actually eating there is like a stale biscuit.

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You've got massive consistency issues.

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This one looks more like a scone than it does a biscuit. Yeah.

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you're going for soft, then it's really soft.

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you're going for biscuit, then you've failed.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I like the chocolate, like the orange.

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I like the fact that you've got just the right proportion

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
of biscuit to icing. I think you've done really well.

319
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
My flowerpots and flour biscuits, they are half iced.

320
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry. But, Jane, they're a very similar thickness,

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
which is difficult to get.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Come on, Bill and Ben, try the biscuits.

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Altogether a very nice biscuit. Oh, thank you.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You've made a very good shortbread biscuit.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's just, when we ask for 24,

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it's very important to have 24, and I'm sure you can pipe well,

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but none of it's finished well.

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I really do apologise that

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
some of them I only got the holes out of the middle.

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They're a little bit of a mess... OK.

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
..but I admire the fact that you tried to make 48 biscuits

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
rather than 24.

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The flavour of the salted caramel is coming through.

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a nice biscuit.

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They look hideous... Oh, OK! ..but they taste amazing.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SHE CHUCKLES

337
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now, this is the chilli. Chilli and lime, yeah.

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that revving up your taste buds, Bezza?

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They're quite different. Great fun.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I love the flavour - that cool lime hits you,

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and then after a couple of bites, the heat just sits on your tongue.

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think they're wheely good.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The finish of them is a little bit clumsy.

344
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Very nice coconut biscuit.

345
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It reminds me of a Thai green curry.

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That was not what I was going for.

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We're looking for bergamot and... Lavender.

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And there's a little citrus.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Two difficult flavours.

350
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And you don't like lavender or bergamot, so...

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I love the flavour. I think the flavour is delicate.

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Right at the end, you've got that orange and lavender.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The actual icing's a little bit informal,

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but the biscuit itself is a winner.

355
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Lovely. Thank you. Thank you.

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You're all about the flavours and you've failed in the past

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
with going overcomplicated.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I love your feather icing.

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, nice smell.

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Nice sound when it hits the plate, too.

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Good texture, not oversweet.

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Great spices in there.

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Coffee comes through at just the right level and a great crunch.

364
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you. Nice one, Tom, you nailed it. I think he likes it, Tom.

365
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You nailed it. Oh, hello. Thank you. That's a worry. Well done.

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I got a handshake! Yeah.

367
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Uniformly...rubbish looking.

368
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But good tasting, I'll have that.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll have that every day of the week.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, I do think the stale biscuit comment was a bit harsh.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, dear, I think I'm really in the bad books.

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Every one should have been 3mm,

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but then we all come in shapes and sizes, don't we?

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We'd all want to be thinner.

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Biscuits - to dunk or not to dunk?

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That is the question.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Now, I love dunking almost as much as a 14th-century witch finder.

378
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So I've come to this swanky hotel...

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Good afternoon, my lovely. Thank you.

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
..to meet up with food writer Anastasia Edwards

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and uncover the history of biscuit dipping.

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sat at a table full of brown, sweet food. Mm-hm.

383
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm in heaven. So where do we start?

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We're going to start at the beginning with the ancient Greeks.

385
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
These beauties are known as paximadia. See what you think.

386
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah. Austerity.

387
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
They were used by warring armies. To throw at each other?

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Probably upon occasion. That could do some damage.

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
However, you've got some soup here. Give it a dip.

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Much better. Better? Mmm. See, there you go.

391
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Meanwhile, over in the Roman Empire,

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
biscotti were originally baked for army rations...

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hm, yes. Dentistry. Have a dunk.

394
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
..before becoming, in the Renaissance,

395
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
a fashionable way to end a meal when dipped in Vin Santo.

396
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mmm!

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes, it's like a boulder soaked in Blue Nun. Right.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I mean, but it works for me. Mm-hm.

399
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
For centuries, biscuits were made for dunking into booze,

400
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
including the langue de chat...

401
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Which means cat's tongue in French, exactly.

402
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
..which is just the right shape for a wine glass.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because, obviously, cats often will drink wine. Indeed.

404
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So that's where it came from.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Especially French cats. Oh, you can't keep them...

406
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So sophistique.

407
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You can't keep them away from a good Languedoc-Roussillon.

408
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's thought the Victorians first paired tea with biscuits,

409
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but if you were posh, there was no dunking at the tea table.

410
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But it wasn't until the arrival of mass-produced dry biscuits

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in the mid-19th century that dunking became as British

412
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
as a nice cup of Rosie Lee.

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Have you ever done this before? I come from a family of dunkers.

414
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Boom, two, three.

415
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Ah-ha.

416
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
One of the many pure joys of being a Brit.

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Absolutely, in the culmination of a tradition that goes back

418
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to the ancient Greeks.

419
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
For their first challenge, the bakers could practice,

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but the Technical Challenge is a complete surprise.

421
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Bakers, welcome back to an afternoon of misery and stress,

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
otherwise known as the Technical Challenge.

423
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
This is one of Mary's recipes.

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Now, you judge this blind, Paul and Mary, so off you go.

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There is a baking workshop happening, I think. Paul,

426
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
maybe your bread needs a bit of attention, so off you go.

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So, Mary and Paul would like you to make 12...

428
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
..Viennese whirls. I'm slightly dizzy.

429
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They should be filled with buttercream and jam

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and you've got one and a half hours.

431
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
On your marks, get set, bake.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The bakers all have the same ingredients...

433
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and a very basic version...

434
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THEY MUMBLE TO THEMSELVES

435
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
..of Mary's recipe.

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm probably going to shoot myself in the foot now

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
by saying I've made it before. I have made it before.

438
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I had a guess, actually, it was going to be Viennese whirls.

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I just wish I'd studied the recipe.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Viennese whirls, Mary.

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Where do you think they can go wrong?

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The actual biscuit itself has very simple ingredients,

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but they've got to get that butter really soft

444
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
when they beat it with the sugar.

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If they don't, it'll be far too stiff,

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
they'll get it in the piping bag and they won't get it out.

447
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You do want to see that swirl in the top.

448
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If the mixture is particularly soft,

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
they might have to fridge them before they actually bake them.

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They're very, very short and crumbly,

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
with a nice proportion of jam,

452
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
then you have the buttercream.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's buttery, it's crumbly, it almost dissolves in the mouth,

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
absolutely delicious.

455
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think it's a great challenge, Mary,

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and you've only given them an hour and a half, too.

457
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I think they should do well.

458
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Just says make A jam.

459
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I made raspberry jam a couple of weeks ago.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The reason I know about the temperature

461
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is on the thermometer it just says jam.

462
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think I've got to have it pretty stiff, because if I don't,

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
it's going to squidge out of the sandwich.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Mmm!

465
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So, make the biscuits, cream together butter and icing sugar.

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Icing sugar.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They've got this kind of really light consistency,

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
so I think this is probably a very important step.

469
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll be creaming it until it's really, really pale and fluffy.

470
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Fingers crossed.

471
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Nice, soft butter.

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's almost kind of white.

473
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
"Cream together butter and the icing sugar and then add the flour."

474
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We've not got any baking powder, so we want quite a lot of air in there.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Not knowing exactly... It feels quite light and fluffy,

476
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
so I'm going to go with that.

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It has to be a sort of consistency that you're able to pipe.

478
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
At the moment, it's still kind of quite hard and dry.

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They want 24 whirls that are 5cm in diameter,

480
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and they're a sandwich biscuit, so I want biscuits to be the same.

481
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I've got to make sure I get the right number today.

482
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
"Pipe 24 whirls onto the baking trays."

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It looks the right consistency, there are no lumps in it.

484
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's a very stiff mixture,

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it's quite hard to get a nice, even whirl.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think it's all right.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Looks quite big.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's quite a thick consistency.

489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You need muscles like Selasi to pipe these.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I just need to give it a bit of a beat just to soften it up a bit.

491
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The mixture's slightly too hard at the moment.

492
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm going to try and put it in the microwave

493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and see if it loosens up slightly.

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's not working out. Mel.

495
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
My mixture is stiff. Right.

496
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So I'm struggling to get it out of the piping bag.

497
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you need a pair of warm hands...

498
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Do you have warm hands? ..either on your bag or on you? Um...

499
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The bag, please.

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why is it so stiff? I don't know.

501
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
45 minutes remain to finish their 12 Viennese whirls.

502
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Three, six, nine, 12.

503
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Two, four, six, eight.

504
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's nice and easy. Second piping attempt.

505
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Softer than it was previously.

506
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I've had the bag in my hand for some time now.

507
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's definitely coming out of the pipe a lot smoother.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think I'm going to stick them in the fridge for a little bit.

509
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I think I'm going to put these ones in the fridge so they gel

510
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and hold their shape a bit better. Don't step back, Rav.

511
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It just says bake.

512
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It doesn't say chill. So I'm just going to bake.

513
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm going in.

514
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Gives us an oven temperature,

515
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
but doesn't tell us how long to cook it for.

516
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm going to start them off at nine minutes.

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It says bake until pale golden brown.

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Just keeping an eye on them.

519
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know how long I have to cook them for.

520
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I've been running out of time lately,

521
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
so I don't want to run out of time again.

522
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
AUSTRIAN ACCENT: All right, bakers? Half an hour on the Viennese whirls.

523
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Half an hour on the Viennese whirls.

524
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let me start making the buttercream, actually. Soft and salted butter.

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
"200g of icing sugar...

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
"..and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract."

527
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'll deal with that in a bit,

528
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
otherwise I'll forget about the oven.

529
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They're not looking too bad.

530
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to take them out.

531
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Give them another minute.

532
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Viennese whirls are pale.

533
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Must try not to drop them.

534
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm happy with those.

535
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They look all right, they kept their whirl.

536
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, God, are these even cooked?

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Slightly flat. To be honest, most of them are.

538
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They've collapsed. And very crumbly.

539
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Flat.

540
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Sandwich with jam and piped buttercream.

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's going to be messy. Oh, there's another one gone.

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Not good, not good at all.

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This has just crumbled.

544
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Bakers, one minute.

545
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
OK, bakers. It's time, please,

546
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
to bring your Viennese whirls and place them behind the photograph

547
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
of yourself on the game altar.

548
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Mary and Paul are looking for 12 perfectly-piped,

549
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
melt-in-the-mouth Viennese whirls,

550
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
filled with raspberry jam and buttercream.

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They have no idea whose are whose.

552
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We've got a few... I know what you're going to say - issues.

553
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah, there are a few issues, a few problems.

554
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
First one.

555
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Now, there is no definition in the biscuit at all.

556
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Beautifully delicate, melts in the mouth.

557
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It tastes good, we don't have the definition.

558
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Right, it almost looks raw, doesn't it?

559
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Could have done with a longer bake. Literally minutes.

560
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Moving on to number three.

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Very flat, broken.

562
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Little bit too long a bake.

563
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We've got the jam beautifully to the edges.

564
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
There's a bit of definition in this one, Mary, and it's a good size

565
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
as well, aren't they? Total agreement.

566
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
There is definition on the top.

567
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And you can see the cream there.

568
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They look good.

569
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's baked well and it's delicate,

570
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
cos it crumbles in the mouth and melts, which is how it should.

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
We've got really good definition on these,

572
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
we can see a swirl of the pipe.

573
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You can see the buttercream inside it as well.

574
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They're very good. You can see

575
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
on this one how thin that is.

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Lost all the definition.

577
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This one's got nice definition.

578
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Bold buttercream.

579
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Everything is right there.

580
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Now, this one's gone very slack.

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
This whole thing's collapsed.

582
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And also, it affects the flavour, it's a little bit oily, isn't it?

583
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It is.

584
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
We've got a little bit of definition on there.

585
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Good whirls, as we say.

586
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Could've done with a little bit longer in the oven, I think.

587
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Moving on to the last one.

588
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Very small, where did the rest of the mix go? Dinky.

589
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
They're lovely and short.

590
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The only thing that's wrong is the size. The size.

591
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Mary and Paul will now reveal

592
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
whose Viennese whirls were technically perfect.

593
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
In 11th place, who is this?

594
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We've lost definition, it was a bit crumbly.

595
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Tenth spot is this one.

596
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's gone really flat.

597
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Michael is ninth. Candice, eighth. Tom is seventh.

598
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Rav, sixth. Val is fifth. And Andrew is fourth.

599
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And in third place here, we've got a good definition.

600
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In second spot...

601
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
..is this one. Who's is this?

602
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's a nice Viennese whirl, well done.

603
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And so in first place.

604
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Absolutely beautiful.

605
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Well piped, we've got a lovely definition.

606
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Just the right amount of jam and cream.

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well done.

608
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm thrilled to bits. I hoped I would be in the top half,

609
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
so once we got into the top half and they still hadn't said my name

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I kept thinking, "Oh, maybe I've done better than I thought I had."

611
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll happily take fourth this week, there were a lot of good whirls.

612
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Tomorrow has to go better, otherwise...

613
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah. Um...

614
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I don't know what to say. Just very embarrassing in there.

615
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
When you look at the whole pack coming into the Showstopper,

616
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it's quite close. Good luck.

617
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Good luck, good luck!

618
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Now, Selasi, what happened in the technical?

619
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He's suddenly last.

620
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He's in a little bit of trouble

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and I would put Louise down there as well.

622
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I shall not forget those sheep.

623
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
They were different thicknesses.

624
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And, dare I say it, Val?

625
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I wasn't impressed with the ice cream biscuits.

626
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's really difficult to see who's going to go at the moment.

627
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Likewise for Star Baker, I think Kate has to go up there,

628
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think she won the Technical.

629
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Engineer Andrew did those precision bee biscuits.

630
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
They looked absolutely perfect.

631
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It was such a sadness when you got into the biscuit - it was soft.

632
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But he did come fourth in the technical.

633
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He could have a blinding day today.

634
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And Candice, actually, her biscuits tasted good.

635
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
She did make 48 biscuits rather than 24.

636
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We'll just have to see how they do in the Showstopper.

637
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
SHE EXHALES

638
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Bakers, welcome to your Showstopper day.

639
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now, Paul and Mary would love you

640
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
to make a 3-D gingerbread story.

641
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Now, this gingerbread story should say something about you.

642
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It should be at least 30cm high,

643
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
there should also be eight characters or objects,

644
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but don't do you and Paul on a big night out with all his friends,

645
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
because that's only two characters. THEY LAUGH

646
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You've got four hours on the clock.

647
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
On your marks, get set, bake.

648
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I want to prove that I deserve my place here.

649
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Everybody wants to do their best, and I'm going to do my best as well.

650
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think it is pretty wide open, so

651
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I want to try and get this really, really right.

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Creating a scene out of gingerbread,

653
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
it's got to be strong enough to stand up and we've got to enjoy

654
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
eating it, that's the main thing.

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I've made gingerbread before at Christmas time - houses.

656
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Now, to be honest, they're probably still there in February.

657
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So if they start collapsing, they've got the recipe wrong.

658
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm doing a traditional gingerbread.

659
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I've been making it for more than 40 years,

660
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
but it's the one my children always loved and I still make it.

661
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Val's trusted gingerbread recipe will celebrate her family's roots.

662
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
A pit for Yorkshire,

663
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
windmill for Holland and the

664
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Empire State Building for New York,

665
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
plus a biscuit version

666
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
of her sister Susan.

667
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You had a bit of a problem with those cones and you didn't finish.

668
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes. So, you really got to finish this time.

669
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I really want you to nail this one for us.

670
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Let's stop talking then. She's only got four hours.

671
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Thank you. Thank you.

672
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Four hours sounds like a lot, but it goes by in a flash in the tent.

673
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Louise, tell us all about your story.

674
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Today, I'm making a gingerbread wedding.

675
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm going to get married next year,

676
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
so I've chosen a church in West Wales which is very simple,

677
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
but very old and beautiful.

678
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So I'm going to try and put that together today

679
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
with a bride and groom and five gravestones. Hang on...

680
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Gravestones? Well, they're outside the church.

681
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm having a couple of zombies as my bridesmaids. Brilliant.

682
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Bride-to-be Louise will make gingerbread flavoured

683
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
with orange and spices.

684
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Her church will be rendered with white icing

685
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and have a liquorice roof,

686
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
a perfect place for her to get married.

687
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's my wedding day,

688
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
so it's got to come out, hasn't it? It's got to be right.

689
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
In a bid to stay in the tent, Louise isn't the only one going to church.

690
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Growing up back in Ghana,

691
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
this is similar to the church I used to go to when I was a kid.

692
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
My mum would be proud.

693
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Selasi's boyhood church will have stained-glass windows

694
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
made with melted boiled sweets.

695
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
He's the only baker not using

696
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
treacle or golden syrup

697
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to make his gingerbread.

698
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
My recipe is honey, so it's very different from the rest.

699
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Everyone else is making a more traditional gingerbread.

700
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's one of the oldest biscuits,

701
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
dating back hundreds of years with a basis of liquid and dry sugars,

702
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
butter, flour and ground ginger.

703
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The key to my gingerbread is probably getting a good structure

704
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
to it, so it doesn't have any eggs in it.

705
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Well, I'm not using eggs in this,

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
cos I just find when you're constructing gingerbread,

707
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it doesn't hold as well.

708
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm going to add eggs.

709
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I just find that this works better for me, so...

710
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Jane is building...Hastings -

711
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
where she was born

712
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and her grandad owned a bakery.

713
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
To recreate the seaside town,

714
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
she'll make a boat, net sheds,

715
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
fishing towers and a beach.

716
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a damp day, who knows, we could have the Leaning Tower of Hastings.

717
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Do you know that somebody else in the room is also doing a church?

718
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, they are, are they? Yes. What church are they doing? OK, so,

719
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
eyes left.

720
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He's doing a church as well? He's doing a church as well.

721
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Does that worry you? No. Good girl.

722
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
While some of the bakers are off to church...

723
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I am making a gingerbread pub.

724
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It is because I was brought up in a pub.

725
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This is going to be my sticky ginger cake for my sticky ginger carpet.

726
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Excellent. Because the carpet was always sticky in the pub. Always.

727
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Candice will use three types of gingerbread to build

728
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
her replica King William pub.

729
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
A traditional biscuit

730
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
for the walls and roof,

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
sticky ginger for the carpet

732
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and ginger thins to make her bar,

733
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
dartboard and locals.

734
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm going to do a pool table...

735
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Are you going to have an old guy sitting at the bar?

736
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, well... Propping. ..potentially, potentially. Got to.

737
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Dog? Pub dog? Our dog, yeah, he's going to be in the pub as well.

738
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Pork scratchings? You're being very ambitious again. I know.

739
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Just try and get it all finished.

740
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I will do. I'm on it.

741
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I've got this. I've got this today.

742
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So, I've got 11 pieces on the house, two reindeers,

743
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
a sleigh which has two parts and two parts in the middle,

744
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
two trees, Santa.

745
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Now I am thinking about it, it sounds quite a bit, actually.

746
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Through the medium of traditional gingerbread,

747
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Michael is aiming to relive

748
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
a childhood dream that came true -

749
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the day he met Santa in Lapland.

750
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, Michael, look, and you saw a real reindeer.

751
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah. That's me making gingerbread.

752
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Little were you to know, Michael... Exactly.

753
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
..as you made gingerbread there...

754
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How old were you, nine? Nine.

755
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
..that you'd be here, 19... Making gingerbread.

756
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
..making gingerbread. Do you still believe in Santa Claus?

757
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Of course. Who doesn't?

758
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Most of the bakers have opted for a single flavour of gingerbread,

759
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but not Kate.

760
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
This one's made with dark muscovado sugar and cloves.

761
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
This one's just ginger and this one's got some cardamom

762
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and lemon in it. Sounds fun.

763
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Kate will use her three gingerbreads to build a Brownie camp,

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
featuring her daughters Rebecca

765
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and Lucy and their troop, watched

766
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
over by a swooping brown owl.

767
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What is the promise badge?

768
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh, I promise... Hang on.

769
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
BOTH: I promise on my honour to do my best...

770
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
To do my duty to God and the Queen.

771
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And to make a really good gingerbread construction

772
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
in the Bake Off. Absolutely! THEY LAUGH

773
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Were you a Brownie, Paul? No.

774
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Were you ever a Beaver, Paul? No.

775
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think you'll be awarded the baker's badge for this.

776
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
The baker's badge, absolutely. I've got a good feeling.

777
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The bakers face an epic task...

778
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
..creating a multifaceted gingerbread flat pack.

779
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Got all the tools. They need to work efficiently...

780
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oops! Short.

781
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
..otherwise they won't have enough time to bake, cool,

782
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
assemble and ice their stories.

783
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
My main concern is getting all the large bits done.

784
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Candice has a few added extras to finish

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
before opening time at the pub.

786
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm making a lime green jelly to go on top of my pool table.

787
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
My little brother used to play pool all the time and, like,

788
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
even when he could barely see over the top.

789
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm doing quite a high structure and I think it needs, therefore,

790
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
to be able to hold a lot of weight.

791
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Tom's peak of gingerbread tells a tale of him

792
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and his best mate, Pod, getting

793
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
dangerously lost up a mountain.

794
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He's hoping his maths

795
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
is better than his geography.

796
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If it falls over, you can blame my Year Nine maths teacher...

797
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
..cos I've worked out the angles and they should stand up

798
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
as a perfect pyramid.

799
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Hello, Andrew. Morning!

800
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Right, can you tell us all about your gingerbread, please?

801
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yes. The structural bit of it, hopefully, plays to my strengths.

802
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Yeah. Where are your schematics then for this?

803
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, this was an original... I was only joking.

804
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've had to simplify it to just 37 elements. 37?

805
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
37 elements? For the scene, yeah.

806
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Andrew's student days punting on the river at Cambridge University

807
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
are brought to live in biscuit form.

808
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
He'll build a boat, bike, swans

809
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and biscuit bridge which will be

810
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
a feat of gingerbread engineering.

811
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Can I just ask, how is the platypus going to feature?

812
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Well, you say that,

813
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
but that's the outline which is then going to have the bike piped on.

814
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, it's a bicycle. I'm sorry.

815
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I did get attacked once... We'll leave you to it.

816
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Good luck, mate. OK, cheers, yeah, lots to do. 37 pieces!

817
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm fine with the flavours and the way it tastes,

818
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
it's just the look that I'm really concerned about.

819
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is it going to stand up, is it going to fall down?

820
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Remembering a family holiday in the Big Apple,

821
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Benjamina is going downtown.

822
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Heated with stem ginger,

823
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
her centrepiece will be the world-famous Chrysler Building.

824
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
There's more than three stages on the actual building,

825
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
but I couldn't do that many, so I've scaled it down a bit.

826
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm making the Empire State.

827
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is an insane thing to do,

828
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
to try and get the right number of windows and floors.

829
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Three bakers have taken to a spot of window glazing.

830
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm using boiled sweets, cos I'm going for a stained-glass effect.

831
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm just filling in my windows.

832
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I want a nice effect on the windows to give it a bit extra.

833
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Each individual gingerbread piece must now be baked to perfection.

834
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is it.

835
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And with so many pieces to go in and out of the oven,

836
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the bakers have to get a move-on.

837
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm going to start with nine minutes.

838
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So I've baked them for about 12 minutes

839
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and I want them to be quite crisp,

840
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
not too soft. If not, when I'm putting it together,

841
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
it'll all just fall apart.

842
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't want to overdo it.

843
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
There we go. My first building.

844
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So, the inspiration is a time when my grandad took me

845
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
to a Christmas fairground.

846
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Rav's made a dark gingerbread with a base of molasses, and

847
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
nestled amid his gingerbread forest will be the star attraction.

848
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This Ferris wheel, I've practised twice.

849
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The first time, it just kind of all collapsed,

850
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
which is not what I want to happen today.

851
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I need to have a look in the oven.

852
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Timing the bake for structural gingerbread

853
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
couldn't be more crucial.

854
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Another minute.

855
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
If it's removed too soon,

856
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the biscuit will not hold its shape.

857
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And no-one wants a gingerbread story with an unhappy ending.

858
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
HE SIGHS

859
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Another minute. It's coming out in 17 seconds.

860
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It is an old church so the render's not completely smooth on it.

861
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm happy with this piece.

862
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's good so far. I need it to come out the oven.

863
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's quite difficult, cos you've got lots of different batches

864
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and you're trying to keep track of them all,

865
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
"Has it been in for five minutes or four minutes or three minutes?"

866
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You've got to use your eye.

867
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That's my pool table top.

868
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
My fixtures and my people are just about done.

869
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I need to do...

870
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
..two more big trees.

871
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
There is going to be a tourist with a camera on the bridge

872
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and then there's going to be three swans.

873
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I think I can smell burning.

874
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Can you smell burning?

875
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Look how burnt it is. All looks a mess.

876
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm actually going to dust it with icing sugar

877
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to cover some of the sins.

878
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Bakers, you've got two hours until we feast

879
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
on your gingerbread structures.

880
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I've never seen so much gingerbread in my life. In my life.

881
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Having found out what the bakers are doing...

882
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I mean, they're out there, aren't they?

883
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
From Andrew with his bridge to Louise with her church...

884
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Every one is different.

885
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The children are cooked now.

886
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And some of them are doing a little bit too much. Yeah, I agree.

887
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I mean, Candice, she's done the carpet, the pool table,

888
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
there's so many elements in that.

889
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The one I'm a little bit worried about is Val.

890
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
A little bit? I'm extremely worried about Val.

891
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
She's been so ambitious.

892
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't think she'll get completed.

893
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I hope so. I hope so, it would be nice.

894
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm really up against time at the moment.

895
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You can see what this scenario is going to be, can't you?

896
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Large arch - tick. Mini arch - double tick.

897
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Walkway - no tick.

898
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Handrail... Oh, no, there should be a tick on the walkway.

899
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Give me the pencil. Am I allowed to? On the walkway? Yeah, the walkway's

900
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
just come out, actually. Oh, that feels good.

901
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's all the ticks done. So now it's the construction.

902
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah, now the construction.

903
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Just one hour to go.

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm making caramel to make glue. I'm using royal icing for my glue.

905
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's not actually holding any weight, it's more just there

906
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to prevent the bits falling away from each other.

907
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Now, Val, I don't in any way want to put the wind up you...

908
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I know. ..but you've got considerably less than an hour...

909
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah. ..and quite a lot to do, I'm thinking. Yeah.

910
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
OK, tell me what you've got to do. She's gone.

911
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I've got to make some icing... OK, good. Icing, yeah.

912
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
..which is to glue the house together.

913
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Shepherding you, Val, shepherding you. Thank you.

914
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And then I have got to pipe on here.

915
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Remember, time waits for no lady or man. No.

916
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
ALARM BEEPS Exactly. Yeah.

917
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Fear is the mind killer.

918
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You've just got to go for it and trust.

919
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You can practice as much as you like, but one little slip can,

920
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
like, your structure can just collapse.

921
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I could do with a few more things to prop it up with, really.

922
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
SHE GASPS

923
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Just don't want to touch that now.

924
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It normally works first time in practice,

925
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
but this hasn't worked at all here, which I'm really annoyed about.

926
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
VAL GASPS She's broken. No!

927
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
She's kind of holding.

928
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But she's not.

929
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I can't believe this has happened to me.

930
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I've had a complete and utter disaster.

931
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
OK, builders, bakers, candlestick makers,

932
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
you've got ten minutes left on this Showstopper.

933
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Ten minutes to go. I'm just trying to get stuff out.

934
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't care what they look like.

935
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I am not giving in.

936
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Santa hasn't gone as well as I wanted.

937
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Oh, bother it.

938
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oops.

939
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
My pool table top.

940
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
This is me.

941
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, you're kidding me!

942
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
At least the bikes are all right.

943
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Gosh, I hate gingerbread.

944
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So not happy.

945
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's actually quite shameful, what I've done.

946
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Bakers, time is very much up.

947
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Please stop whatever you're doing.

948
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Step away from your creations.

949
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
CANDICE: Louise, I'm so sorry.

950
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I can't believe that's just happened to me. That's amazing.

951
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Any supports that you're using, please take them away.

952
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm so sorry to have... It's going to fall.

953
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
SHE GASPS ..to tell you that, bakers.

954
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's collapsed, it's just collapsed this minute.

955
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Have I got to leave it? I'm afraid you have to leave it, Val.

956
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's not as bad as mine, Val. Damn it.

957
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
OK, bakers, if you'd like to leave the tent.

958
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Andrew, can you bring up your gingerbread story, please?

959
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm just going to come up very slowly cos it's got

960
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
some wobbly bits on the top.

961
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This is my Punting In Cambridge gingerbread story.

962
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So quite often, especially after we finished exam season,

963
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
it was quite nice to go punting.

964
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So that's me, asleep in the punt.

965
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The overall effect is absolutely brilliant.

966
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I love the detail.

967
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know, you've added colour, it's sharp, it's clean, it's neat.

968
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Height-wise...

969
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yes, absolutely.

970
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it does crumble.

971
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Hm.

972
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
(Flavour.)

973
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It reminds me of my mum's ginger biscuits.

974
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In a good way? That's a good thing.

975
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, great. Tastes lovely. Tastes really good.

976
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think you should be very proud of that.

977
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's all very enchanting and I think you've executed it very well.

978
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Thank you very much. Well done, Andrew.

979
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So is this your family? It's in a bit of a mess. Yes, it is. OK.

980
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, Is that the Statue of Liberty hanging out the side? Yes, yes.

981
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Bless her, she gave up. I love it. BAKERS LAUGH

982
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I can see that.

983
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I love the relief work on the Empire State.

984
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Thank you. I think that's very clever.

985
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It would have been nice, a little bit of piping,

986
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
it just needs a bit more finish.

987
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We've had a problem with finishing before, haven't we?

988
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So, who's this? That's Susan, my sister. Susan.

989
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The spice is coming through,

990
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
little warming effect from the ginger

991
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and I think your sister tastes lovely.

992
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, your sister's absolutely scrumptious.

993
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
She'll be very pleased to know that.

994
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's a bit messy, if I'm honest.

995
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Quite messy.

996
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's a very nice gingerbread.

997
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's a shame about the decoration. Yeah, it is.

998
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah, it's quite artistic.

999
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm fascinated to see what it's going to taste like.

1000
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's a very nice gingerbread. It's nicely spiced.

1001
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's a good biscuit, thank you.

1002
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You have done beautiful piping round

1003
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and you've done it exceedingly well.

1004
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I think it's absolutely lovely. Thank you.

1005
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It better taste good. Fingers crossed.

1006
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Right, you've got three types of gingerbread.

1007
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm struggling to find the ginger.

1008
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah. And it's quite soft as well.

1009
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It doesn't have that snap that I would expect from a gingerbread.

1010
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It's spicy, the ginger's coming through, it's absolutely fine.

1011
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The problem is that it is a soft gingerbread.

1012
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, sorry. Thank you.

1013
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Did it go to plan? Absolutely not.

1014
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Clove, it's quite strong. OK.

1015
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
What that does, it kids you into thinking it's burnt.

1016
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is it burnt? It may be.

1017
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
The story is my trip to Lapland

1018
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
for Santa's workshop.

1019
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is Father Christmas? Yeah.

1020
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Didn't really turn out as Santa's workshop, in the end.

1021
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Probably Santa's workshop from hell.

1022
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

1023
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I wouldn't give top marks to the actual piping. No.

1024
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
CRUNCHING Crispy.

1025
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's a very good flavour, it's nice and spicy,

1026
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the ginger's coming through.

1027
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's the best gingerbread so far.

1028
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That is absolutely gorgeous.

1029
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Thank you. Fantastic flavours,

1030
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
warmth coming through from the ginger.

1031
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I just think the overall effect is too simplistic for me. Yeah.

1032
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But the biscuit is beautiful.

1033
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It is quite crisp.

1034
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Not a lot of ginger coming through.

1035
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I think overall the design is excellent.

1036
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
For me, being the Gingerbread Challenge,

1037
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'd like to taste the ginger. Yeah.

1038
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Louise, please bring up your gingerbread story.

1039
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'll give you a hand.

1040
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It was my gingerbread wedding,

1041
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
but it's turned into an absolute disaster.

1042
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I didn't want to bring it up, but I have to. I'm so sorry for you

1043
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and your future husband. I know. It doesn't bode well, does it?

1044
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Maybe don't get married in that church, Louise,

1045
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
just in case. No, no.

1046
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's unfortunate, but I think we need to try the biscuit.

1047
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You certainly know it's ginger.

1048
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
The balance is there, it's nice

1049
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
and crispy in there as well which is good.

1050
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's just unfortunate that we've had a bit of a turmoil.

1051
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Very unfortunate, Mary. Sorry.

1052
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Candice, will you bring up your gingerbread story, please?

1053
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Do you need a hand, love? Yeah, can you come and grab my jugs, please?

1054
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think the overall effect is beautiful.

1055
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You've showed us so many skills,

1056
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
good piping and I'm dying to know what's inside. OK.

1057
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Look! There's my brother at the pool table,

1058
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
my mum and dad behind the bar.

1059
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Aw!

1060
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I think the idea is fantastic and

1061
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
even down to the sticky ginger cake carpet.

1062
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Who wants to eat some carpet?

1063
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'll eat a bit of carpet.

1064
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1065
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Great ginger cake that one, actually. Great.

1066
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Very, very good. Thank you.

1067
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Now we're into the structure of the whole pub.

1068
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Got a little bit of crisp, a little bit of bite to it.

1069
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The spices are coming through and they're ginger.

1070
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I think it's superb. Thank you.

1071
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I think it's smashing. Thank you. Well done.

1072
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Now, we had some issues in this Showstopper.

1073
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Who's in trouble, do you think?

1074
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well, I think Val, she struggled on the Signature

1075
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
with her ice cream cone, she was fifth, however,

1076
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
in the Technical, which lifted her up. Yeah.

1077
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But then in the Showstopper, it's all come home to roost again.

1078
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But the whole thing's collapsed and, likewise, talking about collapsing,

1079
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Louise. Struggled with her sheep in the Signature. Yeah.

1080
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
She was tenth in the Technical. And then the Showstopper,

1081
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
there was huge problems with. Everything went wrong for Louise.

1082
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So who do you think's in contention for Star Baker?

1083
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think one of them is Candice.

1084
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I think she's done phenomenally well.

1085
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I really didn't think that she'd get anywhere near finished.

1086
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I think Andrew, the flavour that he got, how neat it was.

1087
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I thought he did really well.

1088
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So, decisions have to be made. Are you in agreement?

1089
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I've got my idea, but I need to talk to Paul about it.

1090
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Go to your tent, my loves, and see if you concur.

1091
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Now, this week, I've got to play good cop and bad cop.

1092
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Let's start with the positive side of things.

1093
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Now, Paul and Mary have decided that the award of Star Baker this week

1094
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
goes to somebody who proved to us all that a tacky,

1095
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
old pub carpet could taste simply divine.

1096
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Candice, you are this week's Star Baker, huge congratulations.

1097
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Well done.

1098
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Which leads me onto the difficult bit.

1099
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We're really, truly sad and sorry to say goodbye this week to...

1100
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
..Louise. We'll be so sad not to have you with us next week,

1101
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
but well done. Thank you.

1102
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
MEL WHISPERS

1103
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
'Biscuits aren't my thing.'

1104
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I came, I tried, I've had a disaster,

1105
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm accepting it, I'm going home.

1106
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Poor Louise, she had a disastrous day,

1107
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
but full marks for carrying it off with a big smile.

1108
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I really did think I was heading for home.

1109
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
In fact, I nearly went and said, "Are you sure?"

1110
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Well done!

1111
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I think Candice has done phenomenally well,

1112
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
she stepped so far ahead of the pack in the Showstopper,

1113
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
there was only one winner and when I spoke to Mary at the end,

1114
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
we both said it at the same time - Candice.

1115
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Thank you so much.

1116
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
That pub was brilliant.

1117
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We'll remember it forever.

1118
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Mum and Dad are going to be really proud because that was them,

1119
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
that was my childhood and there it was in a little box that apparently

1120
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
looked and tasted Star Baker-worthy.

1121
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Next time... SHE FAKE CRIES

1122
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
..can anyone survive...

1123
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the toughest Bread Week Challenges...

1124
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I could really do with another oven. ..Paul has ever put together...

1125
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You're making a right pig's ear, though, aren't you?

1126
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
..with a Signature... It's like wallpaper paste.

1127
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
..that should be sweet... I'm not going to eat it.

1128
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
..a steamy Technical... They've gone huge.

1129
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
..and the closest Showstopper ever.

1130
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
There's a lot riding on this for many people in this tent.

1131
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Disaster.
