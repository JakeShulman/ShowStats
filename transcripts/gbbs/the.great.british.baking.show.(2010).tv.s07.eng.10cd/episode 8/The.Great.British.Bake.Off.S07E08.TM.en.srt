1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Exciting times on Bake Off.
We have gone historical.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm talking Henry VIII,
pageantry, jousting,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,840
heavy, heavy marzipan...

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,920
It's...

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,560
It's TUDOR week.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,240
- TUDOR week?
- Not Tuba week.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,040
I spent money on this!

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,760
Last time...

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,520
- That is better.
- That's better. - Oh, it's sharp. - Good.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,760
..Selasi clung on as Tom became the
seventh baker to leave the tent.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,560
And at last, Andrew's
precision paid off...

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Don't hold the wheel.
Don't hold the wheel.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,560
..as he was crowned Star
Baker for the first time.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,040
I suppose now I'll have to
step it up a gear again.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,640
Now in our first-ever
Tudor quarterfinal...

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,040
What?

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,160
..Paul and Mary have set three challenges

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,160
to test every aspect of British baking...

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,560
..from 500 years ago.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,680
Haven't got the best feeling about it.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
Five bakers remain.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,000
But only four will make
it to the semifinal.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
Coming out, coming out, coming out.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Come on. This is my last chance.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,760
I think being Star Baker
has just about sunk in,

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,040
but being in the
quarterfinal, not quite yet.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
Am I here? Am I actually here?

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,880
It's crazy.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,600
I am the only one in the tent now,

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,320
actually, who hasn't been Star Baker.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,440
In one way, that's an achievement,
because I've gotten that far.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,240
The competition is going to
be really tight, this week.

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,680
Any of us could go home,
I just hope it's not me.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,520
I am very privileged
to be one of the five.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,760
I said we're like the Spice
Girls before Geri left.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,760
Morning, bakers. Welcome
back to the quarterfinal

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,800
and this is, of course,
Tudor week, my liege.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Now, The Tudor period gave us
Shakespeare, flushing toilets

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
and a strapping young
monarch with facial hair

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,640
not unlike Paul Hollywood's.

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,160
Today, for your Signature Bake,
Paul and Mary would love you to make

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,880
a display of shaped pies.

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,840
Now they must be individual pies

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
but come together to form
a magnificent design.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,200
You can use any savoury filling
you like or any pastry you like -

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,520
like Henry VIII, you can
just chop and change.

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
You've got three hours. On your marks.

48
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,160
Get set, my lords and ladies.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,200
- Bake!
- Bake!

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,680
If we did study the Tudors at school,

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
I don't remember much about them.

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,360
1485 to 1603, I think it was.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
(I've been reading the notes!)

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
Selasi thinks I was born
in Tudor times, anyway,

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,120
so I'm just trying to go with it.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
When I think of Tudor times,

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,160
I actually think of Henry VIII's table

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,640
laden with hot water crust game pies.

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,160
They wanted to show off what
their chefs could actually do

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,440
and that's exactly why
we're doing it in the tent.

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,640
A really top-notch pie should have
tasty fillings, beautiful pastry,

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,160
but not so thin that
the filling oozes out

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,120
and a pie that, when you cut it,

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
it holds its shape well.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
Just going to make up my hot water crust.

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,280
Hot water crust pastry
is a Tudor classic.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Looks really healthy, doesn't it?

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,000
A lovely lot of fat in a load of water.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,120
Stiff enough to shape and
firm enough to hold juices

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,640
once it's been filled.

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,680
The water is an easy way to melt the lard

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
to get it evenly distributed.

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello, Jane.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
- Good morning.
- Tell us all about your individual pies.

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
I am making something that
represents a Tudor Rose.

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,200
I haven't got 16 moulds so I
need to do them individually.

77
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
- That is a pain.
- It is.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
Jane is filling her 16 pies

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
with spiced sausage meat, nutmeg,
garlic, thyme and cranberries,

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,320
which will be layered between
thinly sliced chicken breast.

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,520
This is the pie I make at Christmas.

82
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,360
The difficulty is getting the pastry thin

83
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,400
- without the juices flowing out.
- Yes.

84
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,280
Jane, I want to SEYMOUR of those.

85
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,480
- (Jane Seymour.)
- Jane Seymour. Well done.

86
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,280
For his pies, Andrew is
travelling a little further

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
than the court of Henry VIII.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,800
My pies are going to be shaped like
a Leonardo da Vinci-style spiral.

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
Da Vinci was alive during those years,

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
I am not going to confine
it to the British Isles.

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,760
Despite their Italian influence,

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,960
Andrew's pies will be layered
with a classic English combination

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
of potato, chicken, pork
sausage and apricots,

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,720
tossed in sprigs of fresh lemon thyme.

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,000
I've got a presentation stand,
and it's got cogs at the bottom,

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,840
so you'll be able to
turn it from the outside.

97
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,160
They will actually move.

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,200
It will give the illusion that the
pies are interlocking and turning.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,080
Have you got a pastry clutch?

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
What's a pastry clutch?

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,800
A pastry clutch, for your gears.

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,280
- Just ignore her.
- Oh, I see!

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,920
If you want to go into neutral,
you need a pastry clutch.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
Of course.

105
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,720
My pastry's so wet.

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
It's wetter than normal, it's weird.

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,960
It just doesn't feel as
firm as it did at home.

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,640
With their pastry resting...

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm just going to wrap it in
clingfilm and keep it warm.

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,320
..the bakers can move
on to their fillings.

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm doing ox cheek and oyster pie.

112
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,880
I wanted to go with a
cheaper cut of meat.

113
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,160
Growing up, that's what we had.

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,120
The oyster element,
my family love seafood

115
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,200
and when we were growing up,
where we were in north London,

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,320
they used to have all the
fish vans and fish stalls

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
outside the pubs and things.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Candice is the only baker
attempting two fillings for two pies

119
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
with two different pastries -

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,040
a parsley suet crust for
her ox cheek and oyster

121
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,400
and a hot water crust for
her macaroni cheese pies.

122
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,960
To make life even harder,

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,440
she'll be arranging them
in the shape of a fish.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,120
So what sort of mould are you using?

125
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
So they will be my scales

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,840
and then I am hand-raising
my macaroni pies

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,720
into triangular shapes.

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,040
- You're shaping triangles by hand.
- Yeah. - In hot water crust pastry.

129
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,200
Yeah.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
How many pies are you
actually making, Candice?

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
Between 18 and 22.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
- Wow! OK.
- You've got three hours, my love.

133
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,120
- Yeah, three hours.
- OK.

134
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm going to cook this on low heat
just to tenderise the meat a bit.

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,320
I think I am the only one doing
traditional Tudor-ish things.

136
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,560
Selasi's floral design will see
game pies crammed with guinea fowl,

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,440
rabbit, venison and pigeon

138
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,920
surrounded by leaf-shaped
pies of pork and quail egg.

139
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,720
This is a very classic Tudor mix.

140
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
Guinea fowl is one of my favourites.

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,000
It's almost like a street food in Ghana,

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
it is like having a kebab.

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Wow. It's massive in Ghana.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
So in Ghana, are they
wild, the guinea fowl?

145
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
They're livid, Mary.

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,680
- MEL:
- Potent smells going on - no offence, Selasi.

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,960
It's not me, I showered this morning.

148
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm going to pull out my nosegay.

149
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,680
- That's all right.
- That pan is quite potent.

150
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,960
The filling in Benjamina's
pie will also be potent.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,120
They'll look kind of Tudor-ey
and they'll taste different.

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,280
A fiery mix of chipotle
pork and spiced black beans

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,680
will fill the pies in Benjamina's
Mexican-inspired display.

154
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,040
How are you going to shape
them into a Tudor style?

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,600
It's going to be like a sun, keeping with

156
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
the Mexican theme/Tudor theme.

157
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm sorry, I'm trying... OK.

158
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,920
OK, you have got some classic
Spanish Latin flavours

159
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,640
going in a Tudor-style pies.

160
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,560
Tudor empanadas.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,440
OK, bakers, that's an
hour gone and two to go.

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,600
I have my pastry and I
have my bowl of filling.

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,920
It's just all about construction, now.

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,720
It's too soft. I might just make
a new one, cos I've got time.

165
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,800
I want my pastry to be
as thin as I can get it.

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,880
If it's too thick, you'd
be, sort of, "ugh!"

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
I like quite a thick pastry.

168
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
I want to get enough filling in there,

169
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,800
but I want to be confident
it's not going to leak.

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,520
See, that's a lot thicker
than the first one.

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,000
I am much happier with that consistency.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,400
My pancetta lardons frying off,

173
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,040
and then I've got my
white sauce thickening up

174
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,960
and I am just lining my pastry tins.

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,200
Time to start filling.

176
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,640
Mary and Paul are looking for a
firm filling that'll hold together

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,160
when it's cut.

178
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,280
I layer it with sausage meat,

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,160
chicken and then sausage
meat, lots of it.

180
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't want to fill
them quite to the top.

181
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,560
When I filled them right to
the top before, they oozed.

182
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,440
Quail eggs right in the centre.

183
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,200
I can feel the clock ticking.

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,280
- Yes!
- Did you imagine anyone in particular when you were doing that?

185
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
No, I didn't, actually.

186
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
You know what would be really good?

187
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,720
Bite into one and find a pearl.

188
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Maybe not so much if
you break your teeth.

189
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,120
The pearl would just about pay
for the expensive dental work.

190
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Are you sure you need all of those?

191
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,240
If I do 12 pies, then
yes - would you like one?

192
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,560
You know I want one.

193
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,000
The difficulty is getting
them out of the moulds.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,720
I've got to take it out of the mould,

195
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,760
make the next one, take
it out of the mould.

196
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,880
I think if I'd asked my
husband to make 16 moulds,

197
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,960
it might have pushed
things a bit too far.

198
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,120
Just filling them up as quick as I can.

199
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,640
I need to get a move on.

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,000
Steam holes.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,640
These have a long bake. They
could leak slightly in the oven

202
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,760
but you won't know until it happens.

203
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
190 for 25 minutes.

204
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,400
And on with the next ones.

205
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,880
I wanted them at least
one batch in by now.

206
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,440
So I need to do the next batch

207
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,280
and get it in as soon
as physically possible.

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,760
OK, bakers, as Anne of
Cleves said to Henry VIII,

209
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,640
"You're two thirds of the way through."

210
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,440
With multiple pies...

211
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
They're improving.

212
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,920
..and just one oven,

213
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,200
time management during
the final hour is crucial.

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
This should really be in, like, now.

215
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
What I might do is put the
temperature up by five degrees

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,440
just to compensate for having so
many in the oven at the same time.

217
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,640
- Smells good.
- Thank you.

218
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,960
There's quite a lot of intense aromas,

219
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
circulating from this bench.

220
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Wild pigeon stinks.

221
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,640
- Why have you chosen pigeon?
- Um...

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,040
I don't know. I thought it
would be perfect for a game pie,

223
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,080
especially in Tudor times.

224
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,600
They used a lot of these
wild birds and also game.

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
Yes.

226
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,240
These should have been
in, like, ten minutes ago.

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
Not great.

228
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,960
Just got to fill these
and pop them in the oven.

229
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,040
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Top shelf.

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,280
Done.

231
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,640
You can go in the back.

232
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
40 is going to have to do.

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,760
I hope it's cooked.

234
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Go-ing in. Fin-al-ly.

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,520
Bottom or top? Bottom or top?

236
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
Top. No.

237
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
Mm...

238
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,840
Top.

239
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,520
His went in bang on time.
He's...he's just chilling.

240
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,920
Not good for time at all.

241
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm just seeing how they're browning.

242
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
Top ones are not going to be cooked.

243
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,600
Can I bribe you to buy us some time?

244
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,080
I'll bribe you in pie.

245
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,000
(That's a good one, isn't it?)

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,280
Seriously tempted.

247
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm just going to leave them.

248
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,520
Luckily, I don't have to take
them out of moulds and things.

249
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,400
Those who are baking in moulds

250
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,560
will have to judge when to remove them...

251
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
Right.

252
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,080
..to give the sides
the golden brown colour

253
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
Mary and Paul will be looking for.

254
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,080
This is more like a remove and check.

255
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
But if the moulds are removed too soon,

256
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,400
the pastry will be too fragile
and the pie could collapse.

257
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,960
Oh, it's a bit sticky.

258
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,000
My meat ones are now out.

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,080
In my eyes, a pie should
have a little bit of leakage.

260
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,320
It comes out the top.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I think taking off this might help.

262
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,760
If it comes off.

263
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm going to pop them
back in for five minutes,

264
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
make sure they're nice and golden.

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,560
Bakers, you've got ten
minutes left, by the way,

266
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,720
ten minutes left on your Tudor pies.

267
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,880
These are cooked but the others aren't.

268
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,200
It's going to be close.

269
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Those are done.

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Yeah, I'm happy with them.

271
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,200
The game pie, I don't think
that's going to bake in time.

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,080
Yeah, the top ones are
not cooked. I know that.

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,560
I'll take out the bottom ones.

274
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,200
Oh, we've got leakage.

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,680
I've got a broken one, there.

276
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Not good. Still raw on the inside.

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Bakers, you've got five minutes
to make like Anne Boleyn

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
and get AHEAD.

279
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
Come on.

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
Coming out, coming out, coming out.

281
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,880
Three minutes left, they've
got to come out, really.

282
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Just like them a fraction more golden

283
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,560
but I haven't got that fraction.

284
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
That's so sick.

285
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
Paul's just given them a
squeeze and gave me a look.

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,680
So much leakage.

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,640
Sort of Tudor Roses.

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
I think it's cooked on the inside.

289
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,160
As Thomas Cromwell was fond of saying,

290
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,520
"Bakers, your pie challenge is over.

291
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,280
"Please move your pies to
the end of your benches."

292
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,680
Yet no-one remembers that quote.

293
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,280
- Weird, isn't it?
- No-one remembers it.

294
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,200
I can sort of see the Tudor Rose.

295
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,240
They look a beautiful
colour on the outside,

296
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
some of them have split a bit.

297
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
- A little bit.
- I can't see much leakage out of there, which is good.

298
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
We'll try this fella here.

299
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,480
Look at that filling. Very, very good.

300
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,960
When you're lining moulds like this,

301
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,120
you'll always get a little
fat bit right in the corner.

302
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,400
You want to try and get it a
little bit cooler, it helps it.

303
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
Then you can mould it better.

304
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,040
That filling is first-rate.

305
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,600
- Oh, thank you.
- I love all the herbs in there, the spices.

306
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,920
It's holding together.

307
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
- Cranberry is delicious.
- Oh, thank you.

308
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
A little bit of sweetness at the end.

309
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,320
The whole combination
is exceedingly good.

310
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,520
- Thank you.
- Delicious!

311
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
I can sort of see the sun.

312
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Pastry looks a bit ropey on the side.

313
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,200
They look possibly as though
the pastry is not done.

314
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,320
I had to make a new batch,
so that kind of put me back

315
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,920
- and I just rushed it.
- It looks a bit rushed. - Yeah.

316
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,840
Held together well.
Oh, lid's a bit thick.

317
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,120
- Yeah.
- It does look very pretty when you cut through it.

318
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,560
Flavour's stunning in a pie.

319
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,880
The beans actually add
a little bit of heat.

320
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,160
Beautiful.

321
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,520
You are right spot-on
with all the flavours.

322
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,560
- It's just rather poor on the pastry.
- A little bit clumsy. - Mm.

323
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

324
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,840
You've tackled two
pastries, two fillings,

325
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,160
which is quite a lot.

326
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,240
The hot water crust
hasn't such a good colour.

327
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,400
- Mm-hm.
- It feels soft, it needed much longer in the oven.

328
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,600
It's a good flavour and
it's a nice crunchy topping

329
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,480
but there is a bit of a
problem with the pastry.

330
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,160
Because the pasta is
still quite al dente,

331
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,920
and then you hit the pastry,
which is almost al dente,

332
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,560
- you have two matching textures, which is not good.
- OK.

333
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,440
- Is it causing problems with your al dentures?
- It is.

334
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,160
Right. The suet ones, the
pastry has got a great colour

335
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
but they've bled so much and
they are all inconsistent.

336
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,160
It hasn't held well
together all the way through

337
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
and it's sort of oozing out.

338
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,360
It smells wonderful.

339
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,320
There's a little bit,
sort of, gravy in there,

340
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,640
yet it's holding together.

341
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,760
Seasoned beautifully, tastes
great and the pastry is delicious.

342
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,200
It doesn't look great
but it tastes amazing.

343
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
And there's the oyster on the top.

344
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,680
Oh, watch out.

345
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,040
That's pretty good too.

346
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,520
When I look down, it
is a bunch of flowers.

347
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Yeah, bunch of flowers, so the
idea is you've got the centre

348
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,520
rose so they're just growing,
so they're like baby roses.

349
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,400
I do like the shape, you've got
a beautiful colour on the top.

350
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,920
We just want to make sure that
it's baked all the way through.

351
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
This one is the pork.

352
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
Quail should be sitting
right in the middle.

353
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,920
- And indeed it is.
- Oh, well done.

354
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Could've done with a bit
more filling in there.

355
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,840
It's cooked better on the base
than actually it is on the side.

356
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,920
The flavour, however, is delicious.

357
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Right, this is the game one.

358
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,880
I think the walls were just
a little bit too thick.

359
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,080
When it's so thick, it looks underdone.

360
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
It's very gamey and so
that's a very good idea

361
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
to put the pork below it,

362
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,520
otherwise it would be too
strong in the actual pie.

363
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,040
- Right, I think your flavours are pretty good.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,800
Can I turn the gears?

365
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,680
Do you mind if I do it
and then once I've...?

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Words gone out, Andrew. Words gone out.

367
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,160
Rotating the pies.

368
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,680
Oh, I've never seen a mechanised pie

369
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,040
but my dream of an edible
car is that much nearer.

370
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,920
- Thank you.
- I think it's a great idea.

371
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
I love the design of it.

372
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,320
The bake, from the outside,
looks absolutely right.

373
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
I'm curious to see how thick
or thin those walls are

374
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
but it's not bad at all.

375
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,760
It looks as though you could've put

376
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,160
just a little bit more filling on the top

377
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,640
because we have here
quite a gap at the top.

378
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,200
The pastry is lovely and crisp.

379
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
The filling tastes good too.

380
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
You've got sausage meat in there as well?

381
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,280
- Yes, yes.
- It's a good flavour.

382
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,800
The herbs really lighten it up

383
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,120
and, actually, the moisture coming
from the apricots helps the pie.

384
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,960
- I think you've done well, Andrew.
- OK, thank you. - Thank you.

385
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,480
And if I could just order a pork
helicopter, that'd be great.

386
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,000
I've not taken the curse of Star Baker

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
through to this week so far.

388
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,440
Great to get a good start.

389
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,480
That's lovely - but I
suspect no-one's safe.

390
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,520
You've got to perform well in all three
challenges, I think, this weekend.

391
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,960
It does sometimes dawn on me,
like, I'm doing quite a lot.

392
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,160
It's difficult, cos it's...do
I want to rein it all in?

393
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Or do I try and go for it?

394
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,840
I do feel like I want to go for
it, it's quarterfinals week.

395
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
I think mine was one of the weaker ones.

396
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm going into the Technical
a little bit...eh...

397
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,880
Do your best. Try and
smash it, if you can.

398
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,040
If it's a souffle, then, yeah,
I'm packing up, I am going home.

399
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,520
Welcome back, ye olde
bakers, to Tudor times

400
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,480
and your Technical
Challenge this afternoon,

401
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,320
which has been set by Paul.

402
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,360
Sir Paul of Hollywood,
any words of advice?

403
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,760
Follow the pattern carefully.

404
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,480
What can he be referring to?

405
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
Now, my liege, if you
would like to go off.

406
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,280
Chase Mary around the maze, Paul.

407
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Your Technical Challenge
today is to make 12 jumbles.

408
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
You know, jumbles.

409
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,080
OK, these are the sort of thing that
would grace any Tudor biscuit tin.

410
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
- Absolutely.
- If they had biscuit tins.

411
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,200
They'd like you to make
six of each design.

412
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,120
You've got one-and-a-half
hours on the clock.

413
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,520
- On your marks...
- Get set... Bake! - Baketh.

414
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,880
What?

415
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,720
What the...?

416
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,360
I think maybe the jumbles that I know of

417
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,800
are a little bit different to this.

418
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,520
My heart sinks when they
say it's a Paul Technical.

419
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,760
Paul, why did you choose jumbles?

420
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,480
What we're actually testing them
on is a little bit of dexterity

421
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,080
with the biscuit mix itself.

422
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,160
We've got two biscuit shapes
- we have the Celtic knot.

423
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,040
Two pieces, one makes the ring

424
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,920
and the other one makes the shape inside.

425
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,000
Then you have the knot ball.

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,720
This basically is a knot

427
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,560
and then one goes over the
top and one goes underneath

428
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,320
and that creates this ball.

429
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,680
The bake times - now, they vary.

430
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,880
The ball is much, much denser.

431
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,040
If they think they can
put the knot ball on

432
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,280
with the Celtic knot, they're
going to be in trouble.

433
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,760
When does the sugar go on?

434
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,000
A little bit of a glaze with
egg, little bit of sugar,

435
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,320
straight into the oven.

436
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
Now, we're using
aniseed, we're using mace

437
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,240
and we're using caraway.

438
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,160
You can actually taste
the spices in there

439
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,600
as it would've tasted
years and years ago.

440
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,000
So they're, sort of,
very crisp on the outside

441
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,760
yet in the middle, there's
just a bit of softness.

442
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,480
Exactly like me, Mary -

443
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,360
hard on the outside, soft in the middle.

444
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
You're about right.

445
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
It's the quarterfinal, it
doesn't tell you anything at all,

446
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,960
it just says, "Make a biscuit dough".

447
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,040
"Make ye biscuit dough".

448
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,560
Paul has supplied some
of the Tudor ingredients

449
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,440
just as they would have
been 500 years ago.

450
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,920
Oh, look at this thing!

451
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,440
It says, "Caraway seeds, ground".

452
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm going to take the Selasi approach.

453
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,280
That's about as fine as I'm going to get.

454
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,240
One teaspoon. So it asks for
one teaspoon of ground aniseed

455
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,760
and one teaspoon of ground mace.

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,720
I am going for a modern
method, purely for time's sake.

457
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,440
Cos I've spent 11 minutes
grinding that caraway.

458
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,920
I think, in Tudor times, they
wouldn't have had a mixer.

459
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,920
I don't know if it should
be bready or biscuity.

460
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,200
Well, it's a biscuit, so
it should be crisp, right?

461
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,120
I don't even know what the texture
of the biscuit is supposed to be.

462
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,280
It's not going to be like a
real short, crumbly mixture

463
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,000
because we've got to be
able to shape it into knots.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,640
That looks like biscuits.

465
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,200
"Use two-fifths of the dough to
make six knot biscuit balls..."

466
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,960
"..and the remaining
three-fifths to make the knots."

467
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
Has anyone got a calculator?

468
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,800
796, divided by five...

469
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,680
776.

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,240
775.

471
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,840
So that's my biscuit balls one.

472
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,120
Two-fifths of the dough to
make six knot biscuit balls.

473
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,600
So I've just done it in that and now
I have to put them back together.

474
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
Is this right?

475
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm going to make sure the balls
are exactly the same weight.

476
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm being very precise.

477
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,800
55.

478
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,080
That was painful, wasn't it?

479
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,640
I've got that left over.

480
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,440
I might just spread it between them.

481
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
I'll do the knot biscuit ball first

482
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
cos they're relatively straightforward.

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,440
Gives us the kind of shaping,

484
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,320
but the method of getting them
to that shape is up to us.

485
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,680
Just going to roll them out so
they're all the same length.

486
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,360
Just going off that diagram,
working out my proportions.

487
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
So judging by the diagram,

488
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,520
I'm going to try and make it 22
times longer than it is thick

489
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,120
cos that's how long I reckon
that is in that diagram.

490
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,760
"Tie the dough into the shape".

491
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,960
Paul's advice was check the pattern.

492
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm just checking and double-checking.

493
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,480
What did he say? Something about
take care about the shaping?

494
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,680
So you make it into a knot...

495
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,200
"Then join the two loose ends together".

496
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,440
OK.

497
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
Oh, it's going to look like that.

498
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
Oh, that's quite cute, isn't it?

499
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,880
That might be right, I don't know.

500
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,680
Just a little sneak peek
at what people are doing.

501
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,720
No, that's too long - what have I done?

502
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,160
I think my calculation
method might be a bit off

503
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,160
or maybe the diagram isn't the
Holy Grail I thought it was.

504
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,200
It says one loose end under
the knot and one over the knot.

505
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,400
- That would be the middle, right? That looks best...
- Yeah.

506
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,160
It probably symbolises Henry
VIII's and Anne Boleyn's hand

507
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,080
meeting around the knot, ie,
the tricky previous marriage...

508
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,200
- Yeah.
- ..he had with Catherine of Aragon.

509
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,680
- Just a thought, Selasi.
- Yeah. - Chew on that.

510
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,480
It's difficult cos I don't
want to handle it too much.

511
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,320
Handle biscuit dough too much,
it can go a little bit tough.

512
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,200
This one's coming apart,

513
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,120
I'm going to have to do
what I didn't want to do

514
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,600
and rework that one.

515
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,680
Just says, "To finish,
caster sugar for sprinkling."

516
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
Unsure if that goes on before or after.

517
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,280
Sprinkle them with sugar at the
end. And then present them up.

518
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,120
I may just sprinkle some
sugar on after, yeah.

519
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
I don't know if that's right.

520
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,040
Sugar, of course, was the
big Tudor "look at me"...

521
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,680
- Probably had no teeth.
- Yeah, absolutely.

522
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
"Would you like another jumble, dear?"

523
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,360
"No, thank you, I've got no teeth."

524
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,840
I haven't put sugar on them,

525
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm going to put sugar on
them when they come out.

526
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,120
I think I'll give them about 15 minutes.

527
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,600
I think they're going to
take longer than I think.

528
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm going to put both in
the oven at the same time.

529
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,240
Shape the dough into this shape, yeah.

530
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,680
Right, so...I think...

531
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,720
In the middle and then they go to here.

532
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,240
I don't know whether you shape
the Celtic knot all in one go,

533
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,640
or whether you do it in two bits.

534
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,400
Jane, you do know you're supposed
to be doing those with dough?

535
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,040
I do not know how to do it.

536
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,680
That's not right.

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh. Oh, we have something.

538
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,960
It looks like it, but it's just huge.

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Oh, dear. This looks a mess.

540
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,800
You want to get that gap in
the middle, that tiny gap.

541
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, symbolising the dissolution
of the monasteries, possibly.

542
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,440
- Really?
- Yeah, and the division between church and state

543
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,880
and the alienation that Henry felt.

544
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,760
I just want to try and make them
look as though they've got gaps.

545
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,600
I think it's OK, actually.

546
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,320
They're quite big.

547
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,560
OK, bakers, half an hour
until we rumble in the JUMBLE.

548
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,000
They need to go in, quickly.

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,480
These will take a good 15 minutes.

550
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,680
These bottom ones are
just looking very pasty.

551
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
Going in, coming out.

552
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,960
Hope for the best.

553
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm assuming they'll need to be
baked for, like, a very long time.

554
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,440
I just realised something,
cos that doesn't look right.

555
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,840
I was through the recipe
and it says "knot ball"

556
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,680
so I think they should look like this.

557
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
So I need to crack on.

558
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,520
I think I'm going to give
them a couple of minutes more.

559
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,800
And I've been told off for
being pale previously, so...

560
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,000
Candice has gone back
in the oven with hers.

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,440
They're still looking very pale

562
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,680
but...I don't know if I'm
aiming for golden brown, or...

563
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,840
Don't know what I'm aiming for.

564
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,560
Hurry up and bake -
literally, like, hurry up.

565
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,880
Wasted an hour moulding and
shaping, it's not great.

566
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,040
They have not held their shape at all.

567
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,760
They're baking very slowly.

568
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,040
They're taking, like, 20, 25 minutes.

569
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,280
I thought it'd be 20 minutes,
tops. They are taking long.

570
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Probably should have put the sugar
on, that would've helped colour it.

571
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,920
In fact, I might just...

572
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,160
This should've definitely
been on ahead of time, but...

573
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm going to put sugar on the
other ones as well, actually,

574
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
cos I think that's going
to give me more colour.

575
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm going to sprinkle sugar
cos they're not browning.

576
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,360
Approximate, but it'll do.

577
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,720
Oh...

578
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,440
I'm not sure whether this sugar is
supposed to go on before or after.

579
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
Not really clear what you
need to do with the sugar.

580
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,120
Bakers, you've got ten minutes left.

581
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,880
Very tense ten minutes.

582
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,400
I think they're a better colour.
I think it's a nice golden.

583
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm turning the oven up just to
get a bit more heat in there.

584
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,560
Just to sort of make sure it's cooked.

585
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,440
Take them out, take
them out, take them out.

586
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,160
They're a bit on the pale side.

587
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't know if they're done.

588
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,680
They've lost a lot of
definition, which is a shame.

589
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
Candice has got hers so brown.

590
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,800
I don't know if she chucked her
oven temperature up something.

591
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,840
They're just not brown, are they?

592
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,360
I hate Technicals.

593
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,040
Bakers, one minute on your jumbles,
one minute on your jumbles.

594
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
Bakers, all's well that ends well.

595
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,280
If you'd like to bring
your Tudor bakes up

596
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,600
and pop them behind the photo
of yourself on the altar.

597
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,640
- Don't JUMBLE them up now.
- No.

598
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,560
Andrew, they're so tidy.

599
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,560
Paul and Mary will have no
idea whose jumbles are whose.

600
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,360
Right, what we're looking for is

601
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,760
a beautiful, light, golden brown colour.

602
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,280
Crisp on the outside, soft in the middle,

603
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,520
and a good pattern.

604
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,280
The egg wash should have gone on
before the bake with the sugar,

605
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
because that would have
helped with the colour.

606
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,720
Let's start with this one.

607
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,760
There is not much
definition in that shape.

608
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,960
- Pretty crisp, though, aren't they?
- Yeah, they are.

609
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,360
- The flavour is good.
- Isn't it?

610
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,920
Actually, the bake on both of
them are all right, as well.

611
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,080
Moving on - the shapes on the
Celtic knots are a bit unusual.

612
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,960
It isn't evenly formed, is
it? But it's a lovely colour.

613
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That one could have
done with a longer bake

614
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
because this is a denser mix.

615
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,280
The bake is OK, but the
bake on the double knot

616
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,880
is not good, needed longer.

617
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,920
The colour of this one's not bad at all.

618
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
The Celtics are pretty good.

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Now, that's really clear, you
get a space between each one.

620
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,960
Let's have a look at the double.

621
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,840
Yes, that's baked fine.

622
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,440
All the way through, and it's crisp.

623
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,880
- It's a good flavour.
- Sugar has been added either halfway through

624
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
or at the end.

625
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,040
The Celtic knots are a bit strange.

626
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,600
The shape of this is not
good, see how it's broken up?

627
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,800
The whole piece has got
to be the same thickness.

628
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,280
- Thin here and thick here.
- Yes.

629
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,720
Let's have a look at these.

630
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,360
Just about done.

631
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,560
There's not much definition there.

632
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,280
Good flavour coming through.

633
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,360
- Very nice.
- Moving on to the last one.

634
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,920
Now, these look quite pale.

635
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,320
Sugar's been added later

636
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,360
but the biggest problem
is the Celtic knots.

637
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,240
When you look at the Celtic knots here,

638
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,560
they're all the same,

639
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,600
but you can see they are
all too packed together.

640
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,080
You're losing the definition
everywhere, which is a shame.

641
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,480
They need to be pulled out a little more

642
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,560
so you can see spaces between each twist.

643
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,840
The double knots aren't that
bad, but I would expect to see

644
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
a little divot in the middle.

645
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,480
They are just about done.

646
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,840
Which quarterfinalist has
mastered the Tudor Technical?

647
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,920
OK, in fifth place is this one.

648
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,840
- That's me.
- They were too close together,

649
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,280
you had lost the definition.

650
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,720
And in fourth place.

651
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,040
This one is not quite done.

652
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,520
Third place was this one.
Colour was getting better.

653
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,880
And in second place is this one.

654
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,920
A nice shape, the definition wasn't
quite there, but a good effort.

655
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,080
So, in first place is this one.

656
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,640
Well done, Candice.

657
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,160
Nice, bold shapes, big gaps in the middle

658
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,640
and actually, the colour
was pretty good as well.

659
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
I'm really, really
pleased with that today.

660
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
But I'll probably not make one again.

661
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,920
They look like something
out of a Bond film,

662
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,720
or something you might
pull out of your belt

663
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
and fling it across the room

664
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,800
and take someone's eye out with a jumble.

665
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,720
Second. Today has been a
pleasant surprise, actually.

666
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Maybe I'll get in touch
with my Tudor roots.

667
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
At least I'm not last, so
step by step, baby steps.

668
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,880
Baby Tudor steps.

669
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
A few weeks ago, fourth
would have been like,

670
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,560
"Whoo, I got fourth!" But now it's like,

671
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,080
"OK, fourth, that's second to last."

672
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,440
First time bottom in the technical.

673
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,280
Quarterfinals, and yet nothing is clear.

674
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
If anything, after the
Signature and Technical,

675
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,760
things are even more muddied.

676
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,840
Candice and Jane have gone
top to bottom respectively

677
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
over the two challenges.

678
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,520
Candice, she is very
apt to do far too much.

679
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,640
Jane did a brilliant pie,

680
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,400
and then she went right
down in the Technical.

681
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,360
Then you look at Benjamina and Selasi,

682
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280
they're the ones for me, in some trouble.

683
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,480
You've got Andrew, he's
been the most constant

684
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,720
over the two challenges,

685
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,160
and the other four, it could
be any one of them, really.

686
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,080
In the Bake Off, you've
got to be consistent.

687
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,720
What we don't want is to lose somebody

688
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,440
because they had a bad day at the office.

689
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,880
Which sometimes happens.

690
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,720
Morning, bakers. For today's
Showstopper Challenge,

691
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,960
Paul and Mary would love you
to make a marzipan centrepiece,

692
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,080
which the Tudors called a "marchpane",

693
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,440
and was the favourite of Tudor banquets

694
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,080
until Sir Walter Raleigh came along

695
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,440
and invented the cheesy tear-and-share.

696
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,840
Your marzipan must be made from scratch.

697
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,120
It should be 3-D and entirely edible.

698
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,080
- You've got...
- Three-and-a-half hours, my lovely bakers.

699
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,880
- So, on your marchpanes...
- Get set.

700
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
Bake.

701
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,080
I'm nervous about this one.
Time is ruthlessly against me.

702
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,000
These guys are really good so
I need to, sort of, step up.

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,600
Haven't got the best feeling about it.

704
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,720
Could be my last bake.

705
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
Just a bit nervous, I
think, this morning.

706
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,160
What we're asking the bakers to do
is really go to town on marzipan.

707
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,680
I want to see detail. There is
two different types of marzipan.

708
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,720
The marchpane in Tudor
era was often baked,

709
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,120
so it was quite brittle,
almost like a biscuit.

710
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,480
Later on an egg was added,

711
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,760
the marzipan we use
nowadays, it's much softer.

712
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,880
They have got to make a marzipan
so that it keeps its shape,

713
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,760
and make a spectacular
centrepiece from it.

714
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,640
The Tudors loved their feasts.

715
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,600
The more elaborate, the better.

716
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,040
- MEL:
- Before the Bake Off,

717
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,920
to find the most elaborate
marzipan centrepiece,

718
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,800
you had to gain access to the most
exclusive address in Tudor England -

719
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,080
Hampton Court Palace.

720
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,920
By the time Queen Elizabeth
I came to the throne in 1558,

721
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
sugar was the must-have status symbol.

722
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,680
It cost a fortune, and
to show off their wealth,

723
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,040
Tudor aristocrats created
what they called banquets,

724
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,960
a feast of only sugared delicacies.

725
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,080
You knew you had made it at court
if you were invited to a banquet.

726
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,560
So it was the inner sanctum...

727
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,160
- Absolutely.
- ..of the Royals?

728
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,680
All of the closest favourites
of the king and queen

729
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,920
would be invited to dine at a banquet.

730
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,600
The peak of these exclusive
gatherings was marchpane,

731
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,520
the original name for marzipan.

732
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,400
Formed into decorative plates
or elaborate sculptures,

733
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,840
these enormously expensive desserts

734
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,480
became a firm favourite with Elizabeth I.

735
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,120
All of Elizabeth's suitors knew very well

736
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,600
that the way to her
heart was through sugar.

737
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,440
They would craft amazing
marchpanes for her.

738
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
They would let their imagination go wild,

739
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,080
they would make fantastical
beasts, dragons, mermaids,

740
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,000
all kinds of creatures.

741
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,160
One of the grandest ever made
came courtesy of Robert Dudley,

742
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,800
Earl of Leicester.
Determined to win her heart,

743
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,480
he presented Elizabeth with
a giant marchpane replica

744
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,680
of his own castle,

745
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,080
but Dudley's advances
clearly weren't sweet enough,

746
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,400
as our Virgin Queen never married.

747
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,480
But who can win the hearts of Paul
and Mary in the Tudor Showstopper

748
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,040
and book a place in the semifinal?

749
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,960
So, I'm just starting
with my spiced apple cake.

750
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,360
For my marchpane, I'm
attempting a Tudor garden

751
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,760
and, like, a little maze. "Maze."

752
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,760
As well as perfecting her
spiced apple cake base,

753
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,040
Benjamina's place in the
semifinal could rest on her

754
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,560
getting through her maze,

755
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,800
her green marzipan grass and
tree fashioned from puffed rice,

756
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
ganache, and melted marshmallows.

757
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
You are having a maze,

758
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
and we will see how to get
there if we look over the top.

759
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,200
Not a complicated maze.

760
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,520
- Oh.
- Is it just like a road?

761
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
- It's not complicated!
- Thank you.

762
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,960
I'm just grinding up some more nuts,

763
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,800
I don't want great
lumps cos in a genoise,

764
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,120
they'll fall down to the bottom.

765
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
You want it to be as light as possible.

766
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,640
After a difficult Technical Challenge,

767
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,080
Jane is making a walnut genoise sponge

768
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,840
covered with an intricate marzipan
design of swans and roses.

769
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,920
I have chosen a swan theme.

770
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
I am doing this design.

771
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,040
It's going to be fascinating.
There's a lot of detail on that.

772
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,600
There's quite a lot of detail on that.

773
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,760
- It's going to be fiddly.
- Yeah.

774
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,640
So I've gone for slightly Tudor flavours.

775
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,400
Honey, currants, ginger, so a
bit of spice and dried fruit,

776
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
not totally off-period.

777
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,040
Andrew's authentic Tudor flavours

778
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,640
will be guarded by marzipan
Tudor knights on horseback,

779
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,680
complete with jousting poles.

780
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,400
This is going to be at
the head of the table,

781
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
it's got to look bang-on.

782
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
Right, going in.

783
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,680
To give themselves as much
time as possible to perfect

784
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,360
a spectacular display,

785
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,440
everyone's cakes need to begin
baking as soon as possible.

786
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,840
But Selasi still needs to
make one final ingredient.

787
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I am making simnel cake,
which is a fruitcake

788
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,880
with marzipan in the middle.

789
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,800
Selasi's cake of brandy-soaked
fruit will be surrounded

790
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,040
by a fortress of marzipan walls.

791
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,760
His design should be a
show-stopping Tudor history lesson.

792
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,720
The six eyes represent the
six wives of Henry VIII.

793
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,160
- Very good.
- With the crowns there in the centre, I'm making a sword,

794
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,640
and then the sword will
be sticking in the middle

795
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,760
which represents the
Battle of Bosworth Fields.

796
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,080
- Wow.
- You have thought this a lot out, haven't you?

797
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,720
Now, are you putting a
glaze on here, or...?

798
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,480
Yeah, I'm going to make a
kirsch and icing sugar glaze.

799
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,960
You like a bit of alcohol
in your things, don't you?

800
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,560
Um...I don't mind alcohol.

801
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,040
The main ingredients, for
all forms of marzipan,

802
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,440
are ground almonds and sugar.

803
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
- A lot of sugar.
- Modern marzipan is even richer,

804
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,680
with more sugar and
the addition of an egg.

805
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,760
I did try doing all this with marchpane,

806
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,680
but some of my stuff is quite
intricate and it kept cracking.

807
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,120
That's the modern-day
marzipan with eggs in it.

808
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,200
Selasi and Candice are the only bakers

809
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,400
using both modern and
traditional marzipan.

810
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,640
I am making a peacock.

811
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,160
As soon as I heard about the
Tudors, I thought, "Well, peacock",

812
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,080
and then I kind of thought
about a current TV programme

813
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,520
I quite like at the moment.

814
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,280
- Does it have something to do with thrones?
- It might. - And games?

815
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,600
Yes.

816
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,200
The body of Candice's peacock

817
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
will feature four multicoloured sponges

818
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,360
flavoured with orange,

819
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,320
with a hidden surprise in the centre,

820
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,440
and covered in marbled marzipan.

821
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,760
The peacock's head and neck will be
made from puffed rice and chocolate,

822
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,160
and its tail will be made of
three flavours of marchpane.

823
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,880
I've got a lemon one, and then
a more traditional rose water,

824
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
and a mint one.

825
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,000
Have you had a little practice of this?

826
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,560
I've made a lot of peacocks, Mary.

827
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,440
Have you had a lot of banquets at home?

828
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,400
"What are we having her breakfast?"
"We're having peacock again."

829
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,720
"What are we having for
lunch?" "Peacock tail today."

830
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,560
Peacock sarnies.

831
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,280
To be able to craft their Tudor marzipan,

832
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,000
consistency is crucial.

833
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,640
Too dry and it'll crack, too
wet and it won't hold its shape.

834
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,440
The amount of liquid added
can have a dramatic effect

835
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,320
on their finished Showstopper.

836
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,160
Six. Let's give it a
bit more alcohol, seven.

837
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,080
I want to be able to roll
it out and for it to cut

838
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,200
so it does need to be
able to stick together.

839
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,400
Never really made a
marchpane so I don't know.

840
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
I practised without knowing
what they are looking for.

841
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,200
Just adding a tiny bit more water.

842
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,640
Marchpane can be a bit
more crumbly than marzipan.

843
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm quite happy with that, that'll do.

844
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,440
That went quick.

845
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,760
If the bakers are happy
with their sponges...

846
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,880
That looks done.

847
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,880
They're nice and light.

848
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,840
And green. And yellow.

849
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,600
..show-stopping marzipan
construction can begin.

850
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,600
It is supposed to look like a hedge.
I don't know, it looks like a snake.

851
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,680
Crackage.

852
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,520
I went and bought a toy horse
then cast my own moulds from it.

853
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,880
Try and make sure you get it in
to all the detail of the horse.

854
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,440
My nephew, when he saw me doing this,

855
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
"Can I play with the Play-Doh?"

856
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Pretty happy with how
it looks at the moment.

857
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm making weapons.

858
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Home-made template, it is made
from a plastic chopping board.

859
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,800
It's a bit drier,
compared to the marzipan.

860
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,840
And it's cracking.

861
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,040
- Looks like a hedge, doesn't it?
- Yeah, looks great.

862
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,720
If Anne of Cleves was
running down this bit here,

863
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,400
she'd suddenly find herself
out in the open again.

864
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,600
I'm sorry to say,

865
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,560
it's the easiest maze I've ever seen.

866
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,200
- But don't let that put you off.
- Exactly.

867
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,640
Time to see how the horses have come out.

868
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,160
Pretty pleased with that. Right,
now we're going to grill them.

869
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,520
In Tudor times, marchpane would be
baked in an oven until it was firm.

870
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,400
150, very low heat.

871
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,520
I'm baking it cos it needs to be strong.

872
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,600
But while eggless marchpane risks
becoming too brittle in the heat...

873
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,800
Have to really keep an eye on this.

874
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,520
..softer modern marzipan can
begin to melt and expand.

875
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,560
I don't want to leave
it under there too long

876
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,000
cos they really go out of
shape once they're grilled.

877
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,160
You only need about ten minutes.

878
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,640
A fraction too long in the heat

879
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,920
and all the careful shaping
and sculpting could be ruined.

880
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,960
I think this is the most
intense grilling I've ever done.

881
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
Oh, I just lost the tip.

882
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,840
Grilled marzipan goes so out of shape.

883
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,680
Closed up a bit, which is a shame.

884
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,040
It's soft - better let that firm up.

885
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,320
I broke it. I'm making another crown.

886
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,160
Bakers, hate to be a
march-pain in the backside,

887
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,880
but you've only got one hour.

888
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,680
I have got a lot to do.

889
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,640
Just leave that to cool.

890
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,440
This is a surprise.

891
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,640
Inside, I'm going to
fill with blueberries.

892
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,960
Andrew, is that going spare?

893
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,280
That is going spare, there's
quite a lot of excess.

894
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,600
That's great. In my world,
I don't call it excess -

895
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,880
I call it breakfast.

896
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840
That looks a bit hard, that marzipan.

897
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,400
Oh, no, that's wood. I do apologise.

898
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,560
It's supposed to sit on top.

899
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,200
People don't know this about me,

900
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,360
but I am Britain's third-best
peacock impersonator.

901
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,400
I see. OK.

902
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,320
That's a very good peacock.

903
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,000
It's going to be covered in the maze,

904
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,280
so you're not going to see these cracks.

905
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,560
Not great for time, quite
behind where I'd like to be.

906
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,440
Yeah, my marchpane centrepiece
is going to be so bling.

907
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,760
Sorry, that's ruined.

908
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,080
I've got some spare.

909
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,080
Peacocks were a thing in Tudor times,

910
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,000
so I'm bang-on the Tudor trend, there.

911
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,880
Whoa! What was that?

912
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,640
Just putting these little filler
bits in just to try and tidy it up

913
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,280
slightly because it's a bit messy.

914
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
I don't think Mary is going
to want to see any cracks.

915
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,400
Making up my mix to make my head.

916
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,360
It's coming together. It is.

917
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,760
Now, tree. Marshmallows, melt faster.

918
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,480
Painful amount to do.

919
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm so glad I've got time to
go nuts with the decorating.

920
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,000
Right...

921
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,760
I need to make a caramel.

922
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,960
Get my caramel jousting thing done.

923
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
This is going to be
the trunk of the tree.

924
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,080
It has fallen sometimes at
home. It sets really firm.

925
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,920
The caramel's crystallising. So annoying.

926
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,280
I just don't like this grilled stuff.

927
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,560
Hey-ho.

928
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,760
That's really annoying me now.

929
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,200
I'm already on my second one.

930
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,480
Hi, Mel. Exceedingly frustrating, this.

931
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,720
OK, do it again, love. Do it again.

932
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,520
Run, run, run.

933
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,480
Please, this time,
really need this to work.

934
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,080
Bakers, I don't want to
cause you march-pain,

935
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,160
but you have got 15 minutes left.

936
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,680
I'm just going to put some roses on,

937
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,720
and then it's a matter of tarting it up.

938
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,720
Don't tell me it's stuck.

939
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,120
Good control, there we
go, there she blows.

940
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,480
Well done, my love.

941
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,120
Going to blowtorch it.
Haven't got time to grill it.

942
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,160
A little bit burnt - that can be hidden.

943
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,920
Come on, this is my last
chance to get it right.

944
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,800
It can be a bit tight but
it's got to go in the middle.

945
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,320
Let's hope this stands.

946
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,720
We're so nearly there with the caramel.

947
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,880
Just got, like, two minutes.

948
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,240
Come on, dry. They don't look great.

949
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,720
I need to just press
on, press on, press on.

950
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,880
Can't do it without roses.

951
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,800
So just going to go for it, really.

952
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,760
OK, bakers, time is up.

953
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,680
If you'd like to move your
magnificent marzipan centrepieces

954
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,480
to the end of your benches.

955
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,400
- Love that stand. MEL:
- Well done, Jane.

956
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,280
Jane, looking at it from the
top, it looks very Tudor.

957
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,800
I love your swans, the whole
decoration is very good.

958
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,520
I think it looks very neat.

959
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,240
I think you've lost your way
slightly on these pieces here.

960
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,800
- I found, when I grilled them, they really melted.
- Yeah.

961
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,280
Going to be delicious.

962
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,840
That held together well, good
bit of marzipan all the way down,

963
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,320
sponge looks good.

964
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,240
Wow.

965
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,680
The sponge is so delicate.

966
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,760
You chose quite a difficult
sponge, and adding ground nuts,

967
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,960
it could easily lose its volume,
and it's kept its volume.

968
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,600
- It's very good.
- With the marzipan as well, it tastes amazing.

969
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,760
- Oh, thank you!
- I really like it.

970
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,280
Even with the weight of the marzipan,

971
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,960
the weight of the
decoration on it as well,

972
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,760
- it's kept its shape.
- Very nice. - Well done.

973
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,800
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- MEL: - Well done, Jane.

974
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,080
The idea is good.

975
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,760
Jousting pole.

976
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,080
Really, that should have gone
on the hand, on the edge.

977
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,040
I like the horses, I
think the horses are good.

978
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,400
It's a little bit on the clumsy side.

979
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,720
Round the back here, the
marzipan is beginning to drop,

980
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,280
and it's not quite
finished at the bottom.

981
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,400
What you don't want is just
a whole load of currants

982
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,280
sitting at the bottom
- I don't like that,

983
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,040
but the sponge is well cooked.

984
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,200
The honey comes through very strongly,

985
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,440
more than the ginger.

986
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,680
It's a very good sponge

987
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,560
and the marzipan is a good flavour.

988
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,520
It's a shame all the currants
fell down to the bottom.

989
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,880
The texture of your
marzipan is good, though.

990
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,280
It's got a good flavour.

991
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,480
You promised us we were getting
a maze, we've got a maze.

992
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,160
It's quite simplistic.

993
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,040
What you could have done was make
sure that the maze was thinner.

994
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,240
- It's a bit thick.
- Yeah, it puffed up when it baked.

995
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,600
You'd have to be very thin
to get through that maze.

996
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,920
Absolutely. Right...

997
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,800
The marzipan tastes nice.

998
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,120
It could've done with being
bonded to the top of it.

999
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,680
It should really hold
together as we cut through it.

1000
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,640
Your marzipan that you've actually
coated the cake with is very good.

1001
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,280
- It's very thin.
- The cake feels quite doughy.

1002
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,480
It is difficult to make an
apple cake that isn't heavy,

1003
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,520
because you've got quite a high
proportion of apple in here,

1004
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,960
- therefore it does make it rather close-textured.
- Thank you.

1005
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,680
Wow.

1006
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,280
Incredible work and to
incorporate so much marzipan.

1007
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,800
I just hope it tastes good.

1008
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,360
Aw! Proper surprise!

1009
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,560
Proper Tudor surprise.

1010
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,880
Full of blueberries.

1011
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,680
The taste of the orange
sponge is very good.

1012
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,120
- Thank you.
- You've really cracked it,

1013
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,000
we've got even amount of
sponges all the way up.

1014
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,680
They're all peacock colours.

1015
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,320
I want to try the tails.

1016
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,960
That's the lemon. I take it this is mint.

1017
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,880
Got the lemon.

1018
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,720
I've got the mint as well.

1019
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,360
As a challenge, you've ticked
all the boxes and then some.

1020
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,800
Exceptional.

1021
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,800
I quite like the idea of the crown,

1022
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,840
I think you could have
done more with the inside,

1023
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,240
cos that's the focus bit - when
you get closer to the cake,

1024
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,200
that's what you look at and
it looks a bit of a mess.

1025
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,920
It looks a little bit crumbly and
hasn't got quite enough colour.

1026
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,200
Let's have a look. Take that side off...

1027
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,440
The cake, it could do with
just a little longer baking

1028
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,760
and a little lower
temperature in the oven,

1029
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,080
and just as I expected, the
marzipan in the middle melts.

1030
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,520
It's a beautiful flavour.

1031
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,320
This is the other
marzipan that you have...

1032
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,560
- Which is baked, yeah.
- Which is baked.

1033
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,000
Oh, nice.

1034
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,080
Lovely. More like a biscuit.

1035
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,800
I think it is a good crown,

1036
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,960
- I just think the inside is a bit messy.
- Thank you.

1037
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,040
The person we thought was far ahead
at the start of this challenge,

1038
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,240
Andrew, you were a little
underwhelmed by the finish,

1039
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,400
weren't you, Mary?

1040
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,120
He came in with flying colours,

1041
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,200
but he's gone back with this cake here.

1042
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,960
Who do you think has done really well?

1043
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,400
I thought that this wonderful peacock,

1044
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,720
the detail, showed great skill.

1045
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,760
There's one person that has
stepped up again, and that's Jane.

1046
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,480
The flavour of the genoise
and the coffee inside there,

1047
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,120
blended with the marzipan, was delicious.

1048
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,160
Coming into the last challenge, though,

1049
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,960
Benjamina and Selasi were
almost neck and neck,

1050
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,560
and really, I have seen
better from both of them.

1051
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,680
Do you still think it is
between Benjamina and Selasi

1052
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,920
- as to who will leave this week?
- Absolutely.

1053
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,520
Do you know who it's going to
be between the two of them?

1054
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,880
Yeah, I think so.

1055
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,360
Bakers, I get the fun job today.

1056
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,560
I get to announce who has won
the accolade of Star Baker.

1057
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,800
It takes an awful lot of gumption
to go TU-DOR top of the class.

1058
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,560
Today's Star Baker is someone
who put on a wonderful display,

1059
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,720
so give a big...

1060
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,400
..for Candice! Well done.

1061
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,360
I genuinely wish that I
could sneak all five of you

1062
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,520
into next week's semifinal.

1063
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,160
You know that we can't,
somebody has to leave today,

1064
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,440
and I'm very, very sad to say
that the person leaving is...

1065
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,280
..Benjamina. I'm so sorry to see you go.

1066
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,960
We'll really miss you, darling.

1067
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,320
It's been a sheer joy having you.

1068
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,880
- Has it?
- Well done, Andrew.

1069
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,400
- Unlucky, Benjamina.
- Thank you, Paul. - Unlucky, my dear.

1070
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,080
I know, it was...

1071
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,080
Benjamina just said to me
now, "It wasn't my week."

1072
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,320
I said, "No, it wasn't",

1073
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,280
but you can't afford
to slip up on Bake Off.

1074
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,240
We've loved having you.
Wish we could take you.

1075
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,680
I knew it, but, yeah.

1076
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,960
I did not expect it to
be you, I really didn't.

1077
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,000
Quarterfinalist, I
think, once it sinks in,

1078
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,400
it will actually...

1079
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,120
I've done something really, really cool.

1080
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,160
To get this far in itself is an
achievement, so I'm really proud.

1081
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,000
Go for it.

1082
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,320
I'm going to keep on baking.

1083
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,560
No marzipan, no Tudor ever
in my life, oh, my gosh.

1084
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,400
But it's so much fun being in there,

1085
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,720
and it's so much fun
baking with everyone.

1086
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,200
So I think that the part
I'm going to miss the most.

1087
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,040
It's been really special.

1088
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,720
It's a shame to see her go.

1089
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,440
She's a proper sister to me, actually.

1090
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,920
She's probably the only one
that thinks I'm really funny.

1091
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,120
Everyone else thinks I'm
not funny at all, so, yeah,

1092
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,640
it's good to have a friend like that!

1093
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,920
I seriously thought I was going,

1094
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,680
I seriously thought this
morning on the drive in,

1095
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,600
"That's my last bus ride to the tent."

1096
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,240
I proved a lot with that peacock!

1097
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,720
Who would have thought it?

1098
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,320
Proved a lot with a
peacock! But I really did.

1099
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,320
Amazing! Semifinal. Yeah, crikey.

1100
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,800
- Next time...
- Bake, bake, bake, bake, bake.

1101
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,280
..it's the semifinal.

1102
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,520
It's just so empty in here.

1103
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,040
- I have to nail it.
- Four bakers...

1104
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,000
I don't think I've been
quite as nervous as this.

1105
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,600
..three patisserie challenges...

1106
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,840
You've got away with this.

1107
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,320
..three chances.

1108
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,040
This is manic, absolutely manic.

1109
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,560
- Better stop cooking.
- Come on, sleepy.

1110
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,040
But who will make it to the final...

1111
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
Selasi, are you scared
for the first time?

1112
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,160
Yeah.

1113
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,040
..of The Great British Bake Off?
