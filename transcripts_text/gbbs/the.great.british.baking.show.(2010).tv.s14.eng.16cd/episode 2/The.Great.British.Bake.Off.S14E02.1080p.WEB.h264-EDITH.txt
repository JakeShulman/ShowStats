<b>{\an2}I think we've nailed this.</b>
<b>Hey, Paul check this out.</b>
<b>{\an2}Listen, for biscuit week Noel and I</b>
<b>{\an2}have created this digestive that you</b>
<b>can keep dunking in your cuppa</b>
<b>{\an2}and it don't break off!</b>
<b>Look at that!</b>
<b>{\an2}Incredible.</b>
<b>We're taking it to Dragons' Den.</b>
<b>{\an2}We've been doing this for 45 minutes</b>
<b>{\an2}and it's still holding strong,</b>
<b>innit?</b>
<b>{\an2}That's amazing. But what's in it?</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, the usual - flour, sugar</b>
<b>and a secret ingredient.</b>
<b>{\an2}A very thin layer of concrete.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, God!</b>
<b>{\an2}Welcome to</b>
<b>The Great British Bake Off.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you think we'll get a handshake?</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm not so sure, let's go. Ruined.</b>
<b>{\an2}Last time...</b>
<b>{\an2}Why this is doing to me?</b>
<b>{\an2}..our 12 new bakers went wild</b>
<b>for cake...</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't know if that's going to</b>
<b>freak out the judges.</b>
<b>{\an2}"Hi, Rowan, what have you made?"</b>
<b>"A dead lobster."</b>
<b>{\an2}..whilst Cristy and Abbi impressed.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've done a really good job, Abbi.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much.</b>
<b>{\an2}Dan's family dog Bruno fetched him</b>
<b>Star Baker...</b>
<b>{\an2}Nice one, Bruno!</b>
<b>{\an2}Here we go, Norman.</b>
<b>{\an2}..and although Nicky and Tasha</b>
<b>faced extinction...</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't like that, Tasha.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love it!</b>
<b>{\an2}..it was Amos...</b>
<b>{\an2}Piece of poo.</b>
<b>{\an2}..who had to leave the tent.</b>
<b>{\an2}This time...</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh!</b>
<b>{\an2}..the bakers battle biscuits...</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi, get a bit closer.</b>
<b>{\an2}..with a nostalgic signature...</b>
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow time.</b>
<b>{\an2}..a tricky technical...</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm probably doing it wrong.</b>
<b>{\an2}..and show stopping</b>
<b>illusion biscuit banquets.</b>
<b>{\an2}Chuffing heck.</b>
<b>{\an2}Everybody's is so realistic.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who will bask in biscuit brilliance?</b>
<b>{\an2}That is fantastic.</b>
<b>It's so good!</b>
<b>{\an2}And whose cookie...</b>
<b>{\an2}Cristy?</b>
<b>{\an2}..has finally crumbled?</b>
<b>{\an2}Have you used my biscuit dough?</b>
<b>{\an2}You have.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm well buzzing.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's proper nice, innit,</b>
<b>just to get back?</b>
<b>{\an2}I saw those three peaks</b>
<b>and I thought,</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm happy I'm at home. It's nice.</b>
<b>{\an2}Here we go again.</b>
<b>{\an2}Last week was very stressful</b>
<b>but it's a new week,</b>
<b>{\an2}it's a new day, it's a new dawn.</b>
<b>{\an2}Biscuits is completely different</b>
<b>to cakes.</b>
<b>{\an2}I make shortbread quite a lot.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's one of those recipes where you</b>
<b>get quite a lot of plaudits</b>
<b>{\an2}compared to the amount of effort</b>
<b>that you put in.</b>
<b>{\an2}Good to see you, bakers.</b>
<b>Welcome to Biscuit Week.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, for your Signature Challenge</b>
<b>the judges would like you to make</b>
<b>{\an2}a batch of 12 identical</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}Inspired by childhood favourites</b>
<b>{\an2}like the tea cake</b>
<b>or the Wagon Wheel,</b>
<b>{\an2}the judges are looking for</b>
<b>delicious biscuits</b>
<b>{\an2}either topped or sandwiched</b>
<b>with perfectly set marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, you've probably noticed that</b>
<b>these biscuits,</b>
<b>{\an2}they're a lot smaller than they</b>
<b>used to be when we were kids.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, this is your chance</b>
<b>to right that wrong.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's nothing stopping you from</b>
<b>making your biscuit</b>
<b>{\an2}absolutely massive,</b>
<b>like Noel's head.</b>
<b>{\an2}We're looking for dustbin lids, OK?</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, the shape, the flavours and</b>
<b>the design is entirely up to you.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've got two and a half hours.</b>
<b>{\an2}On your marks... Get set...</b>
<b>{\an2}Bake!</b>
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow biscuits isn't something</b>
<b>I've had for a really long time.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's only one marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>as far as I'm concerned</b>
<b>{\an2}and it's a Tunnock's tea cake.</b>
<b>Oh, my days.</b>
<b>{\an2}PAUL: Marshmallow biscuits. Now,</b>
<b>this goes back to our childhood.</b>
<b>{\an2}For me, it was the Wagon Wheel.</b>
<b>It was just the best thing ever.</b>
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow is quite mild in flavour</b>
<b>and sweet.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you need something that lifts it,</b>
<b>like citrusy jam</b>
<b>{\an2}or something with a bit of acidity</b>
<b>will help.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's about decoration, as well,</b>
<b>{\an2}because although it should be</b>
<b>relatively simple</b>
<b>{\an2}to create the biscuits and the</b>
<b>marshmallow, it's about decoration.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's got to look good,</b>
<b>it's got to look shop made.</b>
<b>{\an2}Good morning, Dana. Hello, good</b>
<b>morning. How are you? Hello, Dana.</b>
<b>{\an2}Dana, tell us about your</b>
<b>signature marshmallow biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I am doing a speculoos.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, lovely. Marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>{\an2}that's got a lot of ginger, cloves,</b>
<b>mixed spice, a bit of everything.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, lovely.</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Dana's love of spices</b>
<b>comes from</b>
<b>{\an2}the Indian dishes her mum Chhaya</b>
<b>taught her growing up.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's a lovely golden colour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Almost burnt colour.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not burnt, Mum!</b>
<b>{\an8}Sitting on top of her</b>
<b>spiced biscuit,</b>
<b>{\an8}Dana's vanilla marshmallow and</b>
<b>speculoos biscuit buttercream</b>
<b>{\an8}will be set in an intricate mould.</b>
<b>{\an2}PRUE: Oh, they're beautiful.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's been a bit of a challenge</b>
<b>demoulding it. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}But as long as I've got enough time</b>
<b>to get it in the fridge</b>
<b>{\an2}for a good half hour.</b>
<b>{\an2}It needs to be rock solid for me</b>
<b>to get it out of the mould.</b>
<b>{\an2}So that's what I'm hoping for.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm looking forward to this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Me, too!</b>
<b>Can't wait to have one myself.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's perfect. Right...</b>
<b>{\an2}NOEL: Those who have chosen</b>
<b>to make teacakes</b>
<b>{\an2}will be using moulds to create</b>
<b>the classic chocolate dome</b>
<b>{\an2}which will hold the marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let me just wiggle them around.</b>
<b>{\an2}The outside will be nice and smooth</b>
<b>{\an2}because it's moulded into</b>
<b>the dome shape, thankfully.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm probably a little bit envious</b>
<b>{\an2}of the people who have got moulds,</b>
<b>but hey-ho,</b>
<b>{\an2}I made the decision to go</b>
<b>for Wagon Wheels</b>
<b>{\an2}and when I've made them at home</b>
<b>people have liked it.</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Keith likes to doorstep</b>
<b>his neighbours</b>
<b>{\an2}looking for feedback on his bakes,</b>
<b>{\an2}which has earned him the nickname</b>
<b>Needy Ned.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}Phew! I'm relieved.</b>
<b>{\an8}NOEL: Today he'll be recreating</b>
<b>the all-American</b>
<b>{\an8}peanut butter and jelly sandwich</b>
<b>in Wagon Wheel form.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, a little birdy told me</b>
<b>you was into stand-up.</b>
<b>{\an2}I...I did a bit of stand-up for</b>
<b>a few years about 20 years ago.</b>
<b>{\an2}And was you good?</b>
<b>{\an2}I wasn't good enough to go...</b>
<b>to go full time.</b>
<b>{\an2}Give me your best gag. Come on.</b>
<b>{\an2}The best gag that you...</b>
<b>You've got to get me rolling.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can't. Because... Come on,</b>
<b>everyone wants to hear Alison's</b>
<b>laugh!</b>
<b>{\an2}Then you might find out</b>
<b>I'm funnier than Noel.</b>
<b>{\an2}No, go on. And then what happens?</b>
<b>Go on, go on. It doesn't work!</b>
<b>{\an2}What you got? Come on!</b>
<b>{\an2}Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk!</b>
<b>Come on, you can...</b>
<b>{\an2}BEEPING</b>
<b>You've got something.</b>
<b>{\an2}No. What's...what's the joke that</b>
<b>used to get everyone straight away?</b>
<b>{\an2}Shall I stop that, babe?</b>
<b>{\an1}BEEPING STOPS</b>
<b>#S</b>
<b>{\an2}Um...</b>
<b>What's that timer for?</b>
<b>{\an2}You... Uh, that's time for the</b>
<b>interview to end.</b>
<b>{\an2}Morning Dan. Good morning.</b>
<b>Hello, Dan. How we doing? Hello.</b>
<b>{\an2}Reigning Star Baker.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes, indeed.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tell us about your signature.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes, so it's my son's</b>
<b>birthday tomorrow.</b>
<b>{\an2}So these flavours are based</b>
<b>on the three things</b>
<b>{\an2}that he basically lives on</b>
<b>every day,</b>
<b>{\an2}which is chocolate, bananas</b>
<b>and peanut butter. Wow.</b>
<b>{\an2}What a healthy diet for a child!</b>
<b>Perfect diet, yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Can I help? You can do, mate, yeah.</b>
<b>Yay!</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Four-year-old Sam</b>
<b>and his older brother Rory</b>
<b>{\an2}love to help Dad in the kitchen,</b>
<b>{\an2}especially when there are bowls</b>
<b>to be cleaned.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've got it all down</b>
<b>the front of you already.</b>
<b>{\an8}Covered in dark chocolate,</b>
<b>his peanut biscuits</b>
<b>{\an8}will sandwich layers</b>
<b>of peanut butter ganache</b>
<b>{\an8}and banana marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Have you practised this a lot?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, I've done it three times,</b>
<b>yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Where do you find the time?</b>
<b>{\an2}Soon as the kids are in bed,</b>
<b>that's when I start doing it.</b>
<b>Really? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}And you want to bake, the kids'll</b>
<b>never go to bed right?</b>
<b>{\an2}No, they don't, no. No.</b>
<b>{\an2}And they come in,</b>
<b>especially going...</b>
<b>{\an2}"Oh, can I help, dad?"</b>
<b>"Yeah, of course you can, mate!"</b>
<b>{\an2}And then just, like,</b>
<b>knock a bowl over,</b>
<b>{\an2}spill a load of flour all over the</b>
<b>place and clear off.</b>
<b>{\an2}Chimpanzees' tea party.</b>
<b>Totally, yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm making rose teacakes</b>
<b>and these are for my nan.</b>
<b>{\an2}My nanny June,</b>
<b>she's not with us any more</b>
<b>{\an2}but she loved roses</b>
<b>{\an2}and so they're going to have, like,</b>
<b>little roses painted into the shell.</b>
<b>{\an2}NOEL: Nanny June might be the</b>
<b>inspiration for Cristy's teacakes</b>
<b>{\an2}but it's her youngest daughter</b>
<b>Sienna</b>
<b>{\an2}who's been helping Mum</b>
<b>perfect the recipe.</b>
<b>{\an2}Good girl. Keep going.</b>
<b>{\an8}Cristy will layer rose water</b>
<b>flavoured marshmallow</b>
<b>{\an8}and a mixed berry jam</b>
<b>atop a digestive biscuit,</b>
<b>{\an8}all encased in a delicate</b>
<b>floral white chocolate shell.</b>
<b>{\an2}What do your kids think</b>
<b>of these biscuits?</b>
<b>{\an2}Do they like these ones?</b>
<b>They're just like... Yeah, they do.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're like,</b>
<b>"Why can't we touch 'em?"</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm like, "No, you can't touch 'em</b>
<b>now!"</b>
<b>{\an2}But, yeah, no, they do.</b>
<b>They like 'em, yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}And have you explained to them,</b>
<b>you know, about Bake Off</b>
<b>{\an2}and how it's going</b>
<b>and how exciting it is?</b>
<b>{\an2}Hmm, the little ones don't know.</b>
<b>But my eldest,</b>
<b>{\an2}yeah, but she's just, like,</b>
<b>living her life. She's like...</b>
<b>{\an2}She's living her best life. Yeah.</b>
<b>The thing is, when you're a mum,</b>
<b>{\an2}you've got so much mummy guilt</b>
<b>{\an2}and the kids ain't even bothered,</b>
<b>are they? I know!</b>
<b>{\an2}They're not bothered!</b>
<b>{\an2}"Oh, mum's missing?" Yeah!</b>
<b>"Who cares?"</b>
<b>{\an2}Going to roll 'em out,</b>
<b>aim to get even thickness.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a biscuit that I used to eat</b>
<b>a lot when I played football.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a half-time biscuit, almost.</b>
<b>{\an2}A well-known biscuit.</b>
<b>I've kind of, like,</b>
<b>{\an2}taken the theme of that biscuit</b>
<b>and put it into a Wagon Wheel.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sports mad Matty</b>
<b>and his partner Lara</b>
<b>{\an2}first locked eyes at the local gym.</b>
<b>{\an2}Eight years later they're busy</b>
<b>planning their wedding.</b>
<b>{\an2}Which one are you thinking that</b>
<b>actually looks nice?</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't know. They all look the</b>
<b>same.</b>
<b>{\an8}He's chosen chocolate and orange</b>
<b>flavours</b>
<b>{\an8}for his sandwich style biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an8}He'll be assembling in a mould</b>
<b>for a sharp, elegant finish.</b>
<b>{\an2}I like your tattoo. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}If you win, you've got to get</b>
<b>another tattoo, right? OK.</b>
<b>{\an2}If you win, we'll both get one.</b>
<b>GBBO!</b>
<b>{\an2}I'll get one of you on my chest.</b>
<b>{\an2}Not on your back?</b>
<b>Like that!</b>
<b>{\an2}I've got one of Rahul on my bum.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, we're going in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}The bakers will need to keep</b>
<b>a close eye on their biscuits...</b>
<b>{\an2}Ten minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}We'll check 'em at eight.</b>
<b>{\an2}..as they can go from underbaked</b>
<b>and soft</b>
<b>{\an2}to overbaked and tough</b>
<b>in a matter of minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}12 minutes. 12 minutes in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}Calm exterior.</b>
<b>{\an2}But I'm doing absolute somersaults</b>
<b>inside, yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}But also, they need to make</b>
<b>a start on any extra fillings,</b>
<b>{\an2}curds or jams that will accompany</b>
<b>the marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm just heating up my cream</b>
<b>for my ganache.</b>
<b>{\an2}Raspberries,</b>
<b>I'm making raspberry jam.</b>
<b>{\an2}Look at the colour, see?</b>
<b>It's beautiful.</b>
<b>{\an2}So that's a rhubarb and ginger jam.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is going to be the flavour</b>
<b>kick to the marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Smells amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Nicky and husband Rob</b>
<b>are both retired</b>
<b>{\an2}but like to keep active,</b>
<b>whether it's out rambling</b>
<b>{\an2}with the dogs Haggis and Bracken</b>
<b>{\an2}or doing exercise classes together.</b>
<b>{\an2}Phew!</b>
<b>{\an1}THEY LAUGH</b>
<b>{\an2}He's got bright red cheeks now!</b>
<b>{\an8}Nicky's ginger and rhubarb jam</b>
<b>{\an8}will be the main attraction in</b>
<b>teacakes of pistachio shortbread</b>
<b>{\an8}and vanilla marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you've got rhubarb and ginger as</b>
<b>the hero flavours, really...</b>
<b>Exactly.</b>
<b>{\an2}..with a little hint of pistachio</b>
<b>in the biscuit. Exactly.</b>
<b>{\an2}Very good.</b>
<b>Let's hope it works!</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm doing Black Forest jam teacakes.</b>
<b>Blackberries and blackcurrants</b>
<b>{\an8}are my favourite fruits</b>
<b>to make jam with.</b>
<b>{\an8}And they just work really</b>
<b>lovely together.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love to bake with fruit and stuff</b>
<b>off my garden</b>
<b>{\an2}and I always want them to be</b>
<b>the star of the show.</b>
<b>{\an2}Green fingered Josh</b>
<b>and his younger brother Jake</b>
<b>{\an2}love growing their own fruit</b>
<b>and vegetables.</b>
<b>{\an2}They've even won prizes</b>
<b>for their enormous marrows.</b>
<b>{\an8}Sitting in between his</b>
<b>vanilla marshmallow</b>
<b>{\an8}and dried cherry biscuit base</b>
<b>{\an8}will be Black Forest jam made from</b>
<b>the spoils of his beloved garden.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you feel really relaxed there?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, I love it down there.</b>
<b>Cos it's calm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, I do rugby from</b>
<b>September through till about now</b>
<b>{\an2}and then we go switch</b>
<b>and it's on to... Calm world.</b>
<b>{\an2}All the gardening stuff. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think you're living the way that</b>
<b>everyone wants to live.</b>
<b>{\an2}Growing and then baking.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Rugby, not so sure about.</b>
<b>Just getting pounded in the cold!</b>
<b>{\an2}Good luck. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thought I was your biggest fan?</b>
<b>{\an2}Ha! That's good, that is!</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers... You are halfway through!</b>
<b>{\an2}Taking these out now.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, yes, they look nice. Very good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they look like they did</b>
<b>at home, which is...a good thing.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it's all right.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just a little brown,</b>
<b>{\an2}so I'm happy with that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Saku. Hello, how are you?</b>
<b>How you doing? You all right?</b>
<b>{\an2}Good, thank you very much. Yes, yes.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, do you bake biscuits often?</b>
<b>{\an2}Not very often. Hmm.</b>
<b>At least once a week.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's often! If you're baking</b>
<b>biscuits every single week...</b>
<b>{\an2}Every day is often, I think.</b>
<b>{\an2}Every week is really often.</b>
<b>OK. Yes.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you're good at biscuit making,</b>
<b>then. I hope so!</b>
<b>{\an2}Every Sri Lankan New Year,</b>
<b>instead of baking biscuits,</b>
<b>{\an2}Saku and her family celebrate</b>
<b>by boiling over milk,</b>
<b>{\an2}a tradition that symbolises</b>
<b>prosperity.</b>
<b>{\an2}It run everywhere!</b>
<b>{\an8}Today she'll be serving up</b>
<b>{\an8}an elegant sandwiched pistachio and</b>
<b>raspberry jam marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>{\an8}inspired by a flavour she</b>
<b>fell in love with in Sicily.</b>
<b>{\an2}So whenever we go there</b>
<b>I try pistachio granita.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah, it's heavenly! I love pistachio.</b>
<b>{\an2}While Saku is bringing</b>
<b>a taste of Sicily into the tent,</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha is taking us down under.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm making a malted</b>
<b>chocolate biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}Um, it's like a chocolate drink</b>
<b>{\an2}that I used to have in Australia.</b>
<b>{\an2}Was this called Milo? Yes.</b>
<b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I used to have that in South Africa.</b>
<b>Can you get it here?</b>
<b>{\an2}I can get... I need to know where.</b>
<b>{\an2}Don't tell her. Don't tell her!</b>
<b>{\an2}I'll tell you after.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha moved to Australia with her</b>
<b>mum and brother aged nine,</b>
<b>{\an2}where she got a taste</b>
<b>of the outdoors</b>
<b>{\an2}and for the malted chocolate</b>
<b>milk drink</b>
<b>{\an2}she would enjoy at the end</b>
<b>of every school day.</b>
<b>{\an8}She'll be flavouring every element</b>
<b>{\an8}of her elegantly decorated</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuits</b>
<b>{\an8}with this popular powdered drink.</b>
<b>{\an2}he flavours are very much, like,</b>
<b>childhood flavours</b>
<b>{\an2}so I'll be very sad</b>
<b>if they don't like it!</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha isn't the only baker...</b>
<b>{\an2}Oopsie boopsie!</b>
<b>{\an2}..who spent some of her</b>
<b>childhood in sunnier climes.</b>
<b>{\an2}I used to live in Tunisia</b>
<b>{\an2}and we didn't...they don't</b>
<b>have teacakes there</b>
<b>{\an2}so they're not like</b>
<b>a big childhood thing for me,</b>
<b>{\an2}so I was like, I'll use</b>
<b>the other thing from my childhood</b>
<b>{\an2}that significantly impacted it,</b>
<b>which was living in Tunisia.</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi spent seven years in</b>
<b>Tunisia before returning</b>
<b>{\an2}to rural Cumbria, where she took up</b>
<b>a gravity defying fitness class.</b>
<b>{\an2}Whee!</b>
<b>{\an8}Her Tunisian inspired teacakes</b>
<b>{\an8}will see a zesty orange curd</b>
<b>{\an8}in between her pistachio</b>
<b>and cardamom biscuit</b>
<b>{\an8}and saffron marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Why do you bake?</b>
<b>{\an2}Why? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I like it cos it's like a</b>
<b>creative outlet.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you do other creative things?</b>
<b>{\an2}I do aerial hoop.</b>
<b>What's that?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's like...it's like a...</b>
<b>{\an2}..a hoop that hangs down</b>
<b>from the ceiling</b>
<b>{\an2}and you go, like, upside down in it</b>
<b>and stuff. What?!</b>
<b>{\an2}Where do they have these?</b>
<b>Where does this happen?</b>
<b>{\an2}Uh, it's in a barn on a farm.</b>
<b>{\an2}What, so you drive to a barn...</b>
<b>{\an2}I drive to a barn</b>
<b>and then I get there...</b>
<b>{\an2}You get in an aerial hoop.</b>
<b>{\an2}And then I get in a hoop.</b>
<b>Make shapes.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, and then I go home.</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan, good morning.</b>
<b>Good morning. How are you?</b>
<b>{\an2}Morning, Rowan. Right, Rowan,</b>
<b>{\an2}tell us all about your</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm doing lemon and rosemary</b>
<b>shortbread</b>
<b>{\an2}with a Parma violet marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Parma violet?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah. My nan used to like Parma</b>
<b>violets.</b>
<b>{\an2}They are absolutely disgusting.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, wonderful!</b>
<b>{\an2}This is a vote of confidence.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yorkshire lad Rowan loves to</b>
<b>go for long walks in the Dales</b>
<b>{\an2}with his dad John and mum Moira.</b>
<b>{\an1}WATER FLOWS</b>
<b>{\an2}That's making me want to wee,</b>
<b>that noise!</b>
<b>{\an1}THEY LAUGH</b>
<b>{\an8}His flavour packed teacakes</b>
<b>{\an8}will feature a lemon</b>
<b>and rosemary shortbread</b>
<b>{\an8}and raspberry gel to complement his</b>
<b>Parma violet marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}But I don't know if you like</b>
<b>Parma violet but I told...</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, I love it!</b>
<b>Is it those purple sweets?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes! OK, someone likes it.</b>
<b>I LOVE those sweets.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, so you love Parma violet.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Paul and Prue do not.</b>
<b>They said it's a bit vile, actually.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm whipping up...</b>
<b>What are you going to do?</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, when life gives you</b>
<b>lemons, Alison...</b>
<b>{\an2}Make Parma violet.</b>
<b>Make Parma violet, yeah!</b>
<b>{\an2}Just make sure there's the right</b>
<b>amount of air in these shoulder</b>
<b>pads.</b>
<b>{\an1}HE IMITATES AN AIR PUMP</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one hour left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Marshmallow time.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you know what? before</b>
<b>the competition</b>
<b>{\an2}I've not made</b>
<b>a great deal of it to be honest,</b>
<b>{\an2}but it's a bit like</b>
<b>a Swiss meringue, basically.</b>
<b>{\an2}And then just with the addition of</b>
<b>loads of gelatine to help it set.</b>
<b>{\an2}Key to a marshmallow's pillowy</b>
<b>but firm form</b>
<b>{\an2}lies in the gelatine and sugar</b>
<b>syrup.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm making the sugar syrup with</b>
<b>the caster sugar and golden syrup.</b>
<b>{\an2}Then I will add that to</b>
<b>the egg whites</b>
<b>{\an2}and get it whipped for</b>
<b>a good ten minutes</b>
<b>{\an2}and then it should get you creamy</b>
<b>marshmallow fluff</b>
<b>{\an2}just like, chef's kiss!</b>
<b>{\an2}But bringing this mix to the</b>
<b>right temperature is crucial.</b>
<b>{\an2}So this has to get to</b>
<b>114 to 116 degrees C.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, hurry up!</b>
<b>{\an2}Too hot and their marshmallow</b>
<b>will be tough and chewy.</b>
<b>{\an2}Too cold and it won't set.</b>
<b>{\an2}Here we go.</b>
<b>{\an2}So now that gets poured into</b>
<b>the egg whites.</b>
<b>{\an2}And then gradually it will turn into</b>
<b>a marshmallow fluff.</b>
<b>{\an2}And for those adding flavours...</b>
<b>{\an2}..there's an additional balance</b>
<b>to be struck.</b>
<b>{\an2}Going with some extract into</b>
<b>the marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Only, like, a cap.</b>
<b>Extract can be quite offensive</b>
<b>{\an2}if you use too much of it.</b>
<b>{\an2}It was always going to be</b>
<b>a couple of drops.</b>
<b>{\an2}But now I've spoke to the judges</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it's going to be maybe</b>
<b>one drop, if that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Might just do lemon. Sod it.</b>
<b>{\an2}But while most have</b>
<b>their marshmallows made, Keith...</b>
<b>{\an1}BLEEP</b>
<b>{\an2}..is struggling with</b>
<b>his sugar syrup.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's taking a little bit longer</b>
<b>than I expected for the, um,</b>
<b>{\an2}sugar to start to come up</b>
<b>to temperature.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm a little bit concerned about</b>
<b>the time</b>
<b>{\an2}but we shall see.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got 30 minutes left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Time goes quick.</b>
<b>That's gone really quick.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right. And that's as good</b>
<b>as it will do for me.</b>
<b>{\an2}As Keith races to make</b>
<b>his marshmallow...</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, we're ready.</b>
<b>{\an2}..the rest of the bakers have begun</b>
<b>to build.</b>
<b>{\an2}Smells very Parma violety.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm feeling stressed!</b>
<b>{\an2}But with so much marshmallow,</b>
<b>{\an2}it's essential</b>
<b>the bakers' other elements</b>
<b>{\an2}are able to punch through</b>
<b>the sweetness.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just putting the jam</b>
<b>{\an2}on top of the biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}Not too much. Just a wee layer</b>
<b>that'll just sort of sit.</b>
<b>{\an2}And while many of the bakers</b>
<b>are relying on moulds</b>
<b>{\an2}to achieve a flawless finish...</b>
<b>{\an2}So now it'll set in the fridge</b>
<b>until I demould it.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's if I can get it demoulded.</b>
<b>{\an2}..others are preparing for</b>
<b>a freehand finish.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, I'm going to have to get</b>
<b>dipping. Time is against me now.</b>
<b>{\an2}I just have to go really quickly.</b>
<b>{\an2}Please work,</b>
<b>please work, please work.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have ten minutes left.</b>
<b>{\an2}I really wanted to take my time</b>
<b>on this but... Whoopsy daisy!</b>
<b>{\an2}So now I can start</b>
<b>doing the marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}As Keith's biscuits finally</b>
<b>start coming together,</b>
<b>{\an2}for the teacake contingent,</b>
<b>it's time to demould.</b>
<b>{\an2}Moment of truth, here we go.</b>
<b>{\an2}Once they come out, they're done.</b>
<b>{\an2}But it's just getting them out</b>
<b>that's the tricky bit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, they're coming out</b>
<b>and they're not snapping.</b>
<b>{\an2}I was expecting a breakage,</b>
<b>with my luck today.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, that one's broken.</b>
<b>{\an2}That was challenge, though,</b>
<b>with this mould.</b>
<b>{\an2}I need to get the chocolate</b>
<b>round the edges</b>
<b>{\an2}but you do have to be very delicate</b>
<b>{\an2}and delicacy's not really</b>
<b>in my skill set.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're just so messy underneath.</b>
<b>Going to trim round carefully.</b>
<b>{\an2}Gentle, gentle, gentle...</b>
<b>{\an2}I need to decorate the top...</b>
<b>{\an2}..as best I can.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'll put some peanuts on.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can, like, hide a lot of stuff</b>
<b>with glitter.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's what I'm hoping for!</b>
<b>{\an2}They're just sort of like dodgy</b>
<b>alloy wheels from, like, the 1990s.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, they look messy!</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah, sorry, kangaroo.</b>
<b>You're going to get a messy bum.</b>
<b>{\an2}Perfect!</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, your time is up.</b>
<b>{\an2}Please step away from</b>
<b>your biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}We got 12. That's the main thing.</b>
<b>{\an2}God. That was stressful.</b>
<b>{\an2}They look beautiful. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an8}Mine looks a bag of BLEEP</b>
<b>compared to everybody else's.</b>
<b>{\an8}11 batches of marshmallow biscuits</b>
<b>{\an8}now face the judgment of</b>
<b>Prue and Paul.</b>
<b>{\an8}PRUE: Did you drop three of them?</b>
<b>{\an2}Um, I don't know what</b>
<b>you're on about, Prue!</b>
<b>{\an1}LAUGHTER</b>
<b>{\an2}There's nothing there,</b>
<b>there's nothing to see!</b>
<b>{\an8}I mean, they look amazing</b>
<b>bar these broken ones.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look</b>
<b>and see what it's like inside.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you. It's a lovely interior.</b>
<b>I think the balance</b>
<b>{\an2}between the marshmallow</b>
<b>and the biscuit is good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, it's delicious.</b>
<b>Oh, thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}Very spicy.</b>
<b>{\an2}The topping I like,</b>
<b>{\an2}but it's totally overwhelmed</b>
<b>by the biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's so potent</b>
<b>{\an2}that a delicate thing like</b>
<b>a marshmallow's</b>
<b>{\an2}never going to stand a chance.</b>
<b>Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I don't really agree</b>
<b>{\an2}because, frankly, marshmallow</b>
<b>deserves to be overridden. Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it works beautifully.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much.</b>
<b>That's OK. Thank you, thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, let's have a look.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, my goodness.</b>
<b>That's neat as a pin, isn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}Um, the Parma violet,</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm not getting too much of that,</b>
<b>{\an2}which for me is a good thing. OK.</b>
<b>{\an2}You do get that lemon</b>
<b>coming through.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you end up with a pretty</b>
<b>decent marshmallow biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I think it's amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think you've got</b>
<b>so many flavours in there</b>
<b>{\an2}but you get them one after another.</b>
<b>It's perfect.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done. I was so nervous.</b>
<b>Thank you. Well done. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an8}Very pretty.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I baked a pistachio and vanilla</b>
<b>marshmallow biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think your flavours</b>
<b>are really good.</b>
<b>{\an2}The jam comes through, the biscuit,</b>
<b>you do get that pistachio flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}My only comment would be</b>
<b>{\an2}the biscuit needed a little bit</b>
<b>longer in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh!</b>
<b>{\an8}You could've spun the chocolate</b>
<b>{\an2}a little bit neater than that,</b>
<b>but I do like them.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think they do look pretty nice.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ooh. Oh, wow.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ooh, hello.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think your chocolate's</b>
<b>a bit thick down at the bottom.</b>
<b>{\an2}That should've been paper thin.</b>
<b>{\an2}Your orange jam is delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think if, instead of putting</b>
<b>a blob of jam in the middle,</b>
<b>{\an2}you'd put a layer of jam... Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}..then every mouthful</b>
<b>would've been perfect.</b>
<b>{\an8}Well, they all look neat as a pin</b>
<b>{\an8}and they're certainly identical.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's cut one of these open.</b>
<b>{\an2}Good crack on the chocolate.</b>
<b>{\an2}Looks lovely inside, Josh.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nice and thin.</b>
<b>Chocolate's beautifully done.</b>
<b>{\an2}I like the balance between the</b>
<b>sweet and the tartness...</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah. ..which comes from the jam.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've got the nice fruits</b>
<b>coming through in there.</b>
<b>{\an2}Pretty, pretty spot-on.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, your roses worked, didn't</b>
<b>they? Yeah, they did. Perfect.</b>
<b>{\an2}The rose flavour's definitely there.</b>
<b>{\an2}But I don't think it's too much.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think, yeah, I think you're right.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think the rose level</b>
<b>is about right.</b>
<b>{\an2}The berry in there needed to be a</b>
<b>little bit stronger and more of it,</b>
<b>{\an2}but I think it's very neat and</b>
<b>I think you've done a decent job.</b>
<b>{\an8}They are a bit messy but I do think</b>
<b>they're exciting and attractive.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they look like crowns,</b>
<b>don't they?</b>
<b>{\an1}ABBI LAUGHS</b>
<b>{\an2}There's a lot of orange in there.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes, I think probably</b>
<b>a little bit too much.</b>
<b>{\an2}The biscuit is lovely and crispy</b>
<b>{\an2}but the orange is really punching.</b>
<b>{\an2}And be careful to allow yourself</b>
<b>time to finish off your bakes...</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah. ..with a little bit more</b>
<b>finesse. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an8}Well, at first glance</b>
<b>they look pretty good.</b>
<b>{\an2}When you look a bit closer,</b>
<b>they're a little bit messy.</b>
<b>{\an2}Interesting inside. I mean, you've</b>
<b>got a lot going on in there</b>
<b>{\an2}when it comes to the layers.</b>
<b>{\an2}These are a peanut biscuit</b>
<b>with white chocolate</b>
<b>{\an2}and peanut butter ganache</b>
<b>and a banana marshmallow.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't quite know what</b>
<b>I think about that</b>
<b>{\an2}because I think technically</b>
<b>it's perfect. Hmm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Maybe I don't quite share your</b>
<b>four-year-old's tastes.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, possibly so, yeah, yeah!</b>
<b>{\an2}Texture wise it's spot-on.</b>
<b>{\an2}And not a big thick layer</b>
<b>of chocolate. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's paper thin and that's how</b>
<b>it should be.</b>
<b>{\an2}If you hadn't put the cartwheel on,</b>
<b>{\an2}they would've looked ten times</b>
<b>better. Yeah. I know.</b>
<b>{\an8}Bit messy, aren't they?</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, I knew they weren't gonna be</b>
<b>{\an2}the most attractive offering</b>
<b>in the tent.</b>
<b>{\an2}I, I wasn't planning on them being</b>
<b>quite so messy.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're probably gonna</b>
<b>taste amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}Keith, you're looking really</b>
<b>worried.</b>
<b>{\an2}Keith the truth is, it really</b>
<b>is delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}The, erm, marshmallow's holding</b>
<b>its shape.</b>
<b>{\an2}The raspberry jam is terrific.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the nicest,</b>
<b>crispest biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}So is it ugly but nice?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's beauty and</b>
<b>the beast, that's what it is.</b>
<b>{\an2}Beauty's on the inside.</b>
<b>But look at it. I'll take that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much, Keith.</b>
<b>Cheers.</b>
<b>{\an8}So these are biscuit</b>
<b>with ground pistachios,</b>
<b>{\an2}rhubarb and ginger jam</b>
<b>and then chocolate on the top.</b>
<b>{\an2}Where's the, where's the ginger?</b>
<b>{\an2}The jam. It was, it was there.</b>
<b>Where is it?</b>
<b>{\an2}I, I think it ran a wee bit.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, it ran out</b>
<b>the tent that's what it's done.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's nothing here. Never mind.</b>
<b>{\an2}He's trying to find some.</b>
<b>Oh, stop it!</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Oh, he's trying to see...</b>
<b>Oh, no.</b>
<b>{\an2}No. There's gotta be some somewhere.</b>
<b>{\an2}There is.</b>
<b>I just put a wee thin layer on.</b>
<b>{\an2}Why? Why? Because I didn't want it</b>
<b>to overpower it.</b>
<b>{\an2}See, you've got a wee bit there.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, dearie me, never mind.</b>
<b>{\an2}It is, it is dearie me because</b>
<b>otherwise it's nicely constructed.</b>
<b>{\an2}The biscuit is beautiful,</b>
<b>the chocolate's nice and thin.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've done a good job</b>
<b>but we needed the jam.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, they look very sophisticated</b>
<b>and beautifully piped</b>
<b>{\an2}and the spinning is just so thin</b>
<b>and lovely.</b>
<b>{\an2}My instinct is that</b>
<b>the biscuits are too thick.</b>
<b>{\an2}Because I think that's quite</b>
<b>a mouthful.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think they're,</b>
<b>the biscuit, you think it's thick</b>
<b>{\an8}but it's not because it crumbles</b>
<b>{\an8}and it's so delicate,</b>
<b>{\an8}and the chocolate comes through -</b>
<b>not dark chocolate,</b>
<b>{\an8}but it has a beautiful malted</b>
<b>aftertaste in the mouth.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think they're delicate,</b>
<b>{\an2}I think they're pretty and I have</b>
<b>to...</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, good for you.</b>
<b>Yeah!</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you. Ah. I tell you what,</b>
<b>{\an2}that pleases me as much as it</b>
<b>pleases you.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ooh, that's a handshake. I'll have</b>
<b>two of those. Thanks.</b>
<b>{\an2}I got a Hollywood handshake.</b>
<b>{\an2}I was not expecting that at all.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes!</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm so proud.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't think I could've got any</b>
<b>better than that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Because the judges aren't blind,</b>
<b>{\an2}they could see that it looked</b>
<b>like a flipping mess.</b>
<b>{\an2}You can't be worried about these</b>
<b>things cos it's done.</b>
<b>{\an2}And I can't do anything about it.</b>
<b>{\an2}And so, yeah, you've just got</b>
<b>to enjoy the moment,</b>
<b>{\an2}keep smiling cos that's what</b>
<b>life's all about, isn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}While the bakers could practise</b>
<b>their marshmallow biscuits</b>
<b>{\an2}the next challenge is a mystery.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hello, bakers,</b>
<b>welcome back to the tent.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's time for your Technical</b>
<b>Challenge which today has been set</b>
<b>{\an2}for you by the lovely Prue.</b>
<b>Any words of wisdom?</b>
<b>{\an2}I've only got one piece of advice</b>
<b>for you guys,</b>
<b>{\an2}and that is use your time wisely.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, as always, this challenge is</b>
<b>gonna be judged blind</b>
<b>{\an2}so, guys, off you go.</b>
<b>{\an2}Off you pop and when we say go we</b>
<b>mean go,</b>
<b>{\an2}don't skulk back pretending</b>
<b>to look for your phone charger.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, Prue would like you to make</b>
<b>{\an2}a batch of 12 perfectly baked</b>
<b>custard creams.</b>
<b>{\an2}Your custard creams should be</b>
<b>{\an2}made with a short buttery biscuit</b>
<b>{\an2}and imprinted with that classic</b>
<b>custard cream design</b>
<b>{\an2}and they should be filled with</b>
<b>a custard buttercream.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sounds delicious. You've got one and</b>
<b>a half hours for this.</b>
<b>{\an2}That does not sound long enough.</b>
<b>On your marks.</b>
<b>{\an2}Get set. Bake!</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, my gosh.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've never made custard creams.</b>
<b>I've eaten them. But never made one.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's good because you know what they</b>
<b>look and taste like.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's bad because you know what they</b>
<b>look and taste like.</b>
<b>{\an2}Custard creams. I have no idea.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm a huge fan of custard so I'm</b>
<b>looking forward to all of this.</b>
<b>{\an2}Huge custard man, yeah. I'm from the</b>
<b>North, mate, have it for breakfast.</b>
<b>{\an2}Custard creams, Prue, I think this</b>
<b>is a great Technical Challenge.</b>
<b>{\an2}But do you think it's too simple?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not that simple.</b>
<b>It's actually easy to go wrong.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think the most common problem</b>
<b>will be people not chilling their</b>
<b>{\an2}biscuit dough enough.</b>
<b>{\an2}It needs to go into the oven</b>
<b>really, really cold.</b>
<b>{\an2}If it's a slightest bit warm,</b>
<b>{\an2}the butter will start to melt and</b>
<b>you'll lose the definition</b>
<b>{\an2}and the shape and the next most</b>
<b>common problem will be not getting</b>
<b>{\an2}the creme au beurre</b>
<b>properly chilled.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's all about chilling and timing.</b>
<b>{\an2}Choose your, uh, biscuit Prue. Hmm.</b>
<b>{\an2}It holds together beautifully.</b>
<b>{\an2}Beautiful custard flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}but there's a lovely snap to</b>
<b>it as well in the mouth.</b>
<b>{\an2}I tell you what these</b>
<b>taste a whole heap better</b>
<b>{\an2}than the ones in the packet.</b>
<b>{\an2}First instruction - make biscuit</b>
<b>dough, chill in freezer.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just says make the biscuit dough.</b>
<b>Which is really helpful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thanks, Prue.</b>
<b>{\an2}I actually looked up a custard</b>
<b>cream recipe last night. Shh.</b>
<b>{\an2}You cream together your butter</b>
<b>and sugar and then add in your egg</b>
<b>{\an2}and then you add in your flour</b>
<b>{\an2}and then I've put the custard</b>
<b>powder in with the flour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hey, Dana. Hi, Alison.</b>
<b>{\an2}You look like you're ahead.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, don't say that.</b>
<b>You're doing good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cos that's how it was last week and</b>
<b>I came last, didn't I? But, erm...</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, no, listen, don't</b>
<b>put no pressure on yourself.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah. Have you done this before?</b>
<b>{\an2}No. It's just biscuit, isn't it?</b>
<b>It's just, just biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's just biscuit. It's not</b>
<b>just biscuit, it's a custard cream.</b>
<b>{\an2}Get it</b>
<b>straight in the freezer.</b>
<b>{\an2}I get the impression from how Prue</b>
<b>was describing it that you</b>
<b>{\an2}haven't got a great</b>
<b>deal of time to mess around.</b>
<b>{\an2}Whole thing about this</b>
<b>is freezing</b>
<b>{\an2}cos you've got a stamp</b>
<b>and you wanna be able to stamp it</b>
<b>{\an2}and see it, don't you? Cos</b>
<b>if you don't, what's the point?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not a custard cream.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's kind of amazing.</b>
<b>I know I'd love that. Did you know</b>
<b>that existed until today? No.</b>
<b>{\an2}It, it's brilliant. No, me neither.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's almost like a game.</b>
<b>Where we've got to be the quickest</b>
<b>to the button.</b>
<b>{\an2}To the buzzer? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who's got the baking? Paul or Prue?</b>
<b>{\an2}Paul.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who's gonna win the Bake Off</b>
<b>this year? Don't... Keith.</b>
<b>{\an2}So step number two is for the</b>
<b>custard buttercream, make</b>
<b>{\an2}a sugar syrup in a small pan</b>
<b>and boil to 121 Celsius.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, it's getting very</b>
<b>technical now.</b>
<b>{\an2}Dissolve.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's made like a French</b>
<b>meringue buttercream</b>
<b>{\an2}and I have made one already.</b>
<b>So I know what I'm doing.</b>
<b>{\an2}So this is gonna heat up and then</b>
<b>I'm gonna pour it into my egg</b>
<b>{\an2}yolks and whisk it</b>
<b>until they're really big and fluffy.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, we've just zoomed past 121 so</b>
<b>I'll just leave it there for a sec.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's fine.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've just</b>
<b>got this to 121 degrees.</b>
<b>{\an2}And I shall be plonking it in here</b>
<b>now with the egg yolks.</b>
<b>{\an2}I know you've gotta do</b>
<b>this really slowly.</b>
<b>{\an2}If you chuck it all in it</b>
<b>will like split.</b>
<b>{\an2}The eggs haven't whisked up,</b>
<b>{\an2}the buttercream has all gone to pot</b>
<b>and I need to start again.</b>
<b>{\an2}So it's getting nice</b>
<b>and thick. Which is what we want.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sieve custard powder then</b>
<b>whisk again.</b>
<b>{\an2}Get as much of that as possible.</b>
<b>And give it another whisk.</b>
<b>{\an2}The buttercream's looking better.</b>
<b>I'm still a lot behind though.</b>
<b>{\an2}When ready, whisk the butter into</b>
<b>the buttercream.</b>
<b>{\an2}And once you incorporate</b>
<b>the butter into it,</b>
<b>{\an2}it will obviously increase in</b>
<b>volume, thicken up.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm just gonna keep on whisking it</b>
<b>and then it gets nice and fluffy.</b>
<b>{\an2}If it's too loose it's just gonna</b>
<b>splodge out the side everywhere.</b>
<b>{\an2}Plaafff, it's never good.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is pretty terrible.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can see flecks of yellow but I</b>
<b>can't get it to whisk any more.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm not sure about</b>
<b>the consistency...</b>
<b>{\an2}..but I will go with this.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, roll out the biscuit dough</b>
<b>and chill in the freezer.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a lot of chilling.</b>
<b>We need to make 12.</b>
<b>{\an2}That is 24 biscuits.</b>
<b>So it needs to be thin.</b>
<b>{\an2}Custard creams,</b>
<b>about three mil thick, I reckon.</b>
<b>{\an2}We're rolling, it's looking all</b>
<b>right, yeah, the dough's nice.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cristy.</b>
<b>Have you used my biscuit dough?</b>
<b>{\an2}You have.</b>
<b>Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's my biscuit dough.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah!</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan! Ah, there you go.</b>
<b>I'm so sorry, Rowan.</b>
<b>{\an2}No, it's fine. I thought...</b>
<b>{\an2}Are you swapping dough, you kids?</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan, what really happened?</b>
<b>{\an2}I found my dough missing.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sabotage? Sabotage, no.</b>
<b>Cristy, you've done a great job.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you feel like you rolled his out</b>
<b>better than you're doing yours?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, for sure.</b>
<b>Oh, no, what's going on here?</b>
<b>{\an2}Don't.</b>
<b>{\an2}Feel like this is a bit sticky.</b>
<b>Need a bit more of this. Sorry.</b>
<b>{\an2}Before their dough is ready</b>
<b>to be cut and stamped...</b>
<b>{\an2}I think that'll do.</b>
<b>{\an2}..it must be chilled thoroughly.</b>
<b>{\an2}The longer it chills</b>
<b>the better definition it'll be</b>
<b>{\an2}but the less time it will have</b>
<b>to bake and then cool down.</b>
<b>{\an2}But it's a process that</b>
<b>can't be rushed.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not working. Sticking.</b>
<b>More time in the fridge.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've got 45 minutes left,</b>
<b>everyone, 45 minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}Please be ready, please be ready,</b>
<b>please be ready.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm hoping these are set</b>
<b>{\an2}and they'll push out of this mould</b>
<b>{\an2}but we're gonna find out in</b>
<b>a moment, aren't we? Stamp.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't know how hard to push.</b>
<b>{\an2}Am I gonna go all the way through?</b>
<b>See, look, it's getting stuck.</b>
<b>{\an2}Is this happening for other people?</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm probably doing it wrong.</b>
<b>{\an2}Give it a bit of welly.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, looks all right.</b>
<b>{\an2}Come on, out you come.</b>
<b>It is a pretty little pattern.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's quite sweet, I think.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not a uniform custard cream</b>
<b>but she's the first,</b>
<b>{\an2}it's like the first pancake.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's always the worst one</b>
<b>but we go uphill from here.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're not looking too bad at</b>
<b>the moment.</b>
<b>{\an2}Can I press the button?</b>
<b>{\an2}You can do.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hey, presto.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm gonna go as far</b>
<b>{\an2}and say that was the best one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Some of us have just got the touch.</b>
<b>{\an2}You do. It won't stop sticking</b>
<b>so it's go back in the freezer</b>
<b>{\an2}with a layer of flour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nightmare, aren't they? After you.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's sticking to the... Agh!</b>
<b>..cutter.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah, not at all neat.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm very concerned about this.</b>
<b>{\an2}This dough has gone too soft</b>
<b>to manipulate. Freezer.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got half</b>
<b>an hour left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah. Running out of time.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's not very long.</b>
<b>I need to get mine in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}It just says bake.</b>
<b>13 to start with.</b>
<b>{\an2}Eight minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm gonna go</b>
<b>for about 12 minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're quite pale, aren't they?</b>
<b>{\an2}Quite insipid actually, like me in</b>
<b>the winter.</b>
<b>{\an2}Come on, custard cream.</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi, get a bit closer.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's already melting.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think the design's just gonna</b>
<b>be lost.</b>
<b>{\an2}I didn't chill them long enough,</b>
<b>I know I didn't.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I've put a batch of 12 in.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's gonna be tough to go again.</b>
<b>{\an2}I had timing issues this morning.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got ten minutes left,</b>
<b>ten minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't know when they're gonna</b>
<b>be ready.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, I don't know, I don't know.</b>
<b>It's hard to call, isn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}As soon as I start seeing</b>
<b>them getting brown then they're</b>
<b>coming out.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love a custard cream</b>
<b>{\an2}and I'm gonna be mentally scarred by</b>
<b>them now, aren't I, forever?</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm never gonna be able</b>
<b>to eat one again, am I?</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm coming out.</b>
<b>Mine look a bit ropey.</b>
<b>{\an2}But they're coming out whatever.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're looking all right</b>
<b>I think actually, yeah. Looking</b>
<b>custard cream-ish.</b>
<b>{\an2}That one's nice.</b>
<b>{\an2}This one's gonna be a top.</b>
<b>{\an2}This one's gonna be a bottom.</b>
<b>I'm a man with a plan.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm gonna take these out cos</b>
<b>they've gotta cool down.</b>
<b>{\an2}I will put it in the freezer.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah...</b>
<b>{\an2}I dropped.</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan, what you doing? I'm warming</b>
<b>my cream. Rowan.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't think my buttercream's as</b>
<b>nice as I would like.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've probably overfilled them</b>
<b>but it doesn't matter.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm shaking. This is ridiculous.</b>
<b>I can't do it.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you've got one minute left.</b>
<b>{\an2}If I can't get 12 out at least</b>
<b>I'm-a get six out.</b>
<b>{\an2}I don't know what they're gonna say.</b>
<b>{\an2}They don't look perfect to me.</b>
<b>{\an2}So ugly.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, your time is up.</b>
<b>{\an2}Please come and bring your bakes</b>
<b>{\an2}and place them behind your</b>
<b>beautiful photos.</b>
<b>{\an2}They are so ugly.</b>
<b>They look absolutely...</b>
<b>{\an8}..rubbish.</b>
<b>I've got custard on my trainers.</b>
<b>{\an2}On your meggings? On my megging?</b>
<b>{\an8}Yeah. What's that?</b>
<b>Your megging, trainers.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK, bakers, let's welcome back</b>
<b>our judges.</b>
<b>{\an2}We missed you guys.</b>
<b>{\an2}Paul and Prue are looking</b>
<b>for 12 identical custard creams</b>
<b>{\an2}with their iconic pattern well</b>
<b>defined and filled</b>
<b>{\an2}with a smooth custard buttercream</b>
<b>{\an2}and they have no idea</b>
<b>whose are whose.</b>
<b>{\an2}Not very easy, but you seem</b>
<b>to have more or less managed it.</b>
<b>{\an2}More or less!</b>
<b>{\an2}Shall we start over here, Prue?</b>
<b>{\an2}They look a bit pale,</b>
<b>is my first thought.</b>
<b>{\an2}They do look a bit pale.</b>
<b>{\an2}There is a bit of definition</b>
<b>there... Yes, it's good.</b>
<b>{\an2}..and they are pretty neat.</b>
<b>{\an2}And they're not overfilled.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nice snap.</b>
<b>{\an2}That biscuit just needs</b>
<b>a bit longer in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's got a slightly floury taste.</b>
<b>{\an2}Moving on to number two.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now these lost a little bit of</b>
<b>definition here.</b>
<b>{\an2}The filling inside is a bit sparse.</b>
<b>{\an2}Also it's not quite set. Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Still very soft.</b>
<b>And so's the biscuit actually.</b>
<b>{\an2}Not much snap to that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Again, I think it needs a little</b>
<b>longer in the oven. Yeah, it does.</b>
<b>{\an2}This one unfortunately</b>
<b>has very little definition.</b>
<b>{\an2}You can't read "custard cream"</b>
<b>on it. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, filled though.</b>
<b>Difference in thickness and thin.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're just not rolled enough</b>
<b>because the dough was quite soft.</b>
<b>{\an2}The custard is</b>
<b>better than the biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, it is.</b>
<b>{\an2}This has got a bit of colour</b>
<b>to it, which I quite like.</b>
<b>{\an2}We expect a little bit more</b>
<b>definition, but it's not bad.</b>
<b>{\an2}The piping's pretty good. Yeah.</b>
<b>Mm-mm.</b>
<b>{\an2}And tastes properly baked. Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Moving on. Lovely colour,</b>
<b>pretty even on the top and bottom.</b>
<b>{\an2}Very, very good. Well filled.</b>
<b>Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Needed a little bit longer</b>
<b>in the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a pity because,</b>
<b>apart from that,</b>
<b>{\an2}I would've said that's pretty</b>
<b>faultless. They look wonderful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, this one's got a little bit</b>
<b>more colour on it.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's a bit of definition here,</b>
<b>{\an2}although it's washed out on</b>
<b>a few of them. Well filled.</b>
<b>{\an2}The custard comes through really</b>
<b>nicely in it. Good flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Same old problem.</b>
<b>A little bit underbaked.</b>
<b>{\an1}THUNDER RUMBLES</b>
<b>{\an2}Lost a bit of definition in places.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, and a little unevenly filled.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}There is actually a little bit</b>
<b>of a crunch to that.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not bad, but it's a</b>
<b>bit...thick.</b>
<b>{\an2}This one, a lot of them,</b>
<b>are misshapen.</b>
<b>{\an2}That one's thin at one end</b>
<b>and fat at the other.</b>
<b>{\an2}That one there's got no definition</b>
<b>on it at all.</b>
<b>{\an2}That custard actually curdled.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a shame.</b>
<b>{\an2}This has got nice definition.</b>
<b>Beautiful. Nice and equal.</b>
<b>{\an2}Colour's right. It's got the</b>
<b>slight brown hue to it.</b>
<b>{\an2}That looks really good.</b>
<b>Nice and thin.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, mm-hm. Now you're talking,</b>
<b>really crispy.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's a custard cream.</b>
<b>In fact that's a lot better</b>
<b>{\an2}than a commercial custard cream.</b>
<b>Very, very good.</b>
<b>{\an2}These are a bit messy.</b>
<b>Uneven, no definition, the dough</b>
<b>{\an2}was obviously very soft, very</b>
<b>difficult to cut.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's like rubber.</b>
<b>Not a success, sadly. Mm-hm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hmm. Now these look great.</b>
<b>Don't they look good?</b>
<b>{\an2}Even, they look very professional.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sadly, slightly underbaked. You know</b>
<b>why, it's cos they're too thick.</b>
<b>{\an2}Mm-hm, another couple of minutes</b>
<b>that would've been perfect.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a real shame.</b>
<b>{\an2}ALISON: Paul and Prue will now rank</b>
<b>the custard creams</b>
<b>{\an2}from worst to best.</b>
<b>{\an2}In 11th place, we have this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Keith, they're a bit of a mess.</b>
<b>Bit misshapen.</b>
<b>{\an2}They look like they were done</b>
<b>in a rush.</b>
<b>{\an2}In 10th spot, we have this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Saku, a real mess and too soft,</b>
<b>slightly underbaked.</b>
<b>{\an2}In ninth place, we have this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cristy, they're a bit uneven.</b>
<b>{\an2}And so, you don't get</b>
<b>the definition.</b>
<b>{\an2}NOEL: Tasha's in eighth place,</b>
<b>{\an2}Dana seventh,</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh sixth,</b>
<b>{\an2}Matty fifth</b>
<b>{\an2}and Nicky in fourth.</b>
<b>{\an2}And in third place,</b>
<b>we have this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan, they're really nice,</b>
<b>{\an2}they're just a little bit soft.</b>
<b>{\an2}In second, we have this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Whose is this?</b>
<b>{\an2}To be honest,</b>
<b>these were pretty good,</b>
<b>{\an2}just not as good as number one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Which means the winner is this one.</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi! Pretty well perfect</b>
<b>custard creams, well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, I'm just so, so relieved!</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, "Better than a commercial</b>
<b>custard cream."</b>
<b>{\an2}That's high praise.</b>
<b>I'm really pleased about that.</b>
<b>{\an2}I pulled that out the bag,</b>
<b>didn't I, really.</b>
<b>{\an2}That is so much better than last</b>
<b>week when I came 12th.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can have a drink tonight now!</b>
<b>{\an1}Seventh place!</b>
<b>{\an2}Just the Showstopper remains</b>
<b>before Paul and Prue decide</b>
<b>{\an2}who will be leaving the tent</b>
<b>{\an2}and who will be crowned</b>
<b>this week's Star Baker.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm really enjoying biscuit week.</b>
<b>{\an2}For me, highlight, Tasha's</b>
<b>handshake. That was incredible.</b>
<b>{\an2}I missed it. It was my first one,</b>
<b>it was amazing. Well deserved.</b>
<b>{\an2}It was well deserved. She dropped</b>
<b>a little bit in the Tech.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'd like to see her do really</b>
<b>well in the Showstopper. Yes.</b>
<b>{\an2}So who do you think is in danger of</b>
<b>going? I think Keith is in trouble.</b>
<b>{\an2}The actual marshmallow biscuit</b>
<b>he created looked awful.</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, really big lumps</b>
<b>of nuts on the top.</b>
<b>{\an2}But the taste was very good.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think Dana is in</b>
<b>a little bit of trouble.</b>
<b>{\an2}Struggled in the Sig and she</b>
<b>was seventh in the Technical.</b>
<b>{\an2}What about No Jam Nicky?</b>
<b>That was the funniest.</b>
<b>{\an2}No Jam Nicky!</b>
<b>She had literally no jam whatsoever.</b>
<b>{\an2}She picked two flavours,</b>
<b>rhubarb and ginger, which</b>
<b>really bring a flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Beautiful flavours</b>
<b>and then hardly put them in.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who is in line for Star Baker</b>
<b>at the moment?</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan. Tash.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can't call it. I can't call it,</b>
<b>can you call it? Nobody can.</b>
<b>{\an2}Not even the god of baking,</b>
<b>Paul Hollywood!</b>
<b>{\an2}No, not even Paul Hollywood.</b>
<b>{\an2}Morning, bakers.</b>
<b>{\an2}For your Showstopper challenge,</b>
<b>{\an2}Prue and Paul would like you to make</b>
<b>an amazing illusion biscuit display,</b>
<b>{\an2}which is depicting</b>
<b>your favourite meal.</b>
<b>{\an2}What if their favourite meal</b>
<b>is a plate of biscuits?</b>
<b>{\an2}You didn't think about that,</b>
<b>did you, Paul?</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, you can choose any style of</b>
<b>biscuit. It's completely up to you.</b>
<b>{\an2}But it's got a taste amazing</b>
<b>and look visually realistic.</b>
<b>{\an2}You have four hours,</b>
<b>which seems a hell of a lot of time.</b>
<b>{\an2}On your marks. Get set. Bake.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm looking forward</b>
<b>to the challenge today.</b>
<b>It's a bit different, isn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's like something you never</b>
<b>think of doing basically,</b>
<b>so it's pretty cool.</b>
<b>{\an2}I feel like I'm a very</b>
<b>creative person,</b>
<b>{\an2}so I love coming up with new ideas.</b>
<b>{\an2}So it's kind of like my way,</b>
<b>I can finally get inventive.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm very excited, I really am.</b>
<b>{\an2}We've asked them to make a meal or</b>
<b>a banquet scene out of biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}It could be burgers, it could be</b>
<b>pizzas, it could be anything.</b>
<b>Mine personally? Pizza.</b>
<b>{\an2}They really have to be a little</b>
<b>bit artistic with this</b>
<b>{\an2}and certainly a little bit of</b>
<b>sculpting knowledge would be useful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nearly all the biscuits they bake</b>
<b>are going to have to be a very</b>
<b>{\an2}specific shape, so there is a real</b>
<b>danger of overworking the dough.</b>
<b>{\an2}And we all know that if you</b>
<b>overwork the dough it gets tough</b>
<b>{\an2}and loses its crumbly texture</b>
<b>and its crack.</b>
<b>{\an2}We want the biscuits</b>
<b>to taste good, look good,</b>
<b>{\an2}but look like something else.</b>
<b>{\an2}I want it to really have</b>
<b>that wow factor</b>
<b>{\an2}because it is the Showstopper</b>
<b>{\an2}and certainly for one baker</b>
<b>it's their last bake.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hello, Josh. Hello. Hello, Josh.</b>
<b>Right, Josh, illusion bake.</b>
<b>{\an2}What are you doing?</b>
<b>I am doing burger and fries.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've got five different</b>
<b>types of biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've got a gingerbread</b>
<b>for the chopping board</b>
<b>{\an2}and then the burger</b>
<b>is going to be a Florentine.</b>
<b>{\an2}Florentine, that's a very good idea.</b>
<b>It looks so realistic as well.</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh's gingerbread board will</b>
<b>display his orange shortbread fries</b>
<b>{\an2}and his towering burger complete</b>
<b>with his Florentine patties,</b>
<b>{\an2}almond flavoured burger buns</b>
<b>{\an2}and salad made from strawberry</b>
<b>flavoured sugar biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love this idea. You've thought</b>
<b>this through really well.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you know what would</b>
<b>really help you?</b>
<b>{\an2}If you get a real burger and chips</b>
<b>and put it to the side,</b>
<b>{\an2}just so we've got something to look</b>
<b>at the difference between the two.</b>
<b>{\an2}Shall we order it now? Yes.</b>
<b>You might lose it though.</b>
<b>{\an2}It might disappear down Paul's neck!</b>
<b>See you, Josh. Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh isn't the only baker recreating</b>
<b>their favourite fast food feast.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I am making pizza.</b>
<b>{\an2}It was an absolute no-brainer.</b>
<b>{\an2}I literally probably have pizza</b>
<b>every Friday night.</b>
<b>{\an2}Dana's gravity defined pizza</b>
<b>{\an2}will comprise a maple pecan</b>
<b>shortbread base,</b>
<b>{\an2}date rolled stuffed crust</b>
<b>and a tuile pepperoni.</b>
<b>{\an2}What happened in the Signature?</b>
<b>Paul said he did like it.</b>
<b>{\an2}He literally said those words.</b>
<b>What about Prue? Prue liked it.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's not enough though, is it?</b>
<b>It was very good cop, bad cop.</b>
<b>{\an2}You need blue eyes to like it,</b>
<b>don't you? Are you slightly angry?</b>
<b>{\an2}Livid.</b>
<b>{\an2}First batch in.</b>
<b>{\an2}With multiple batches to bake</b>
<b>{\an2}in various shapes, sizes,</b>
<b>thicknesses and doughs...</b>
<b>{\an2}That's going to go in the oven</b>
<b>for 36 minutes.</b>
<b>{\an2}..the bakers will need to work</b>
<b>as efficiently as possible...</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, behave yourselves.</b>
<b>{\an2}..if they are to keep their biscuit</b>
<b>production line running smoothly.</b>
<b>{\an2}There is just so much to do.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've selected things and done them</b>
<b>at the right thickness,</b>
<b>{\an2}so the oven temperature doesn't</b>
<b>really need to change much at all</b>
<b>throughout the whole bake.</b>
<b>{\an2}I bake these, then they come out.</b>
<b>Then I bake my steamer basket.</b>
<b>{\an2}Then I bake the other half</b>
<b>of my steamer basket.</b>
<b>{\an2}Then I bake my dumplings.</b>
<b>Then I bake my other dumplings.</b>
<b>{\an2}Then I do the batter ones</b>
<b>towards the end.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just got to tick everything off to</b>
<b>make sure I don't miss anything.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm going to do like a cheeseboard.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've made marzipan to go on top</b>
<b>of the biscotti to give you</b>
<b>the cured meat illusion.</b>
<b>{\an2}What's happening here?</b>
<b>Is that bacon?</b>
<b>{\an2}I knew it looked like bacon,</b>
<b>but it's not. What is it?</b>
<b>It's supposed to be Parma ham.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, it does</b>
<b>look like Parma ham. Does it? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Alongside her marzipan ham</b>
<b>covered biscotti,</b>
<b>{\an2}Cristy's grazing board will feature</b>
<b>fondant-topped ginger biscuits</b>
<b>{\an2}masquerading as slices of cheese,</b>
<b>{\an2}and chorizo and orange</b>
<b>and pistachio biscuits</b>
<b>{\an2}that will be stacked to make</b>
<b>an array of cheeses.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, look at the bacon!</b>
<b>{\an2}It's Parma ham.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's Parma ham. It's not bacon.</b>
<b>{\an2}Same thing, innit?</b>
<b>That's what I said!</b>
<b>{\an2}It does look like bacon. All right,</b>
<b>don't laugh at me.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cristy's not the only baker counting</b>
<b>on cured meat</b>
<b>{\an2}to make an impression.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is sugar cookie prosciutto.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love a charcuterie night</b>
<b>with my mates.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's quite nice to get everyone</b>
<b>around the dinner table,</b>
<b>{\an2}and you can just kind of chill out,</b>
<b>talk to people,</b>
<b>{\an2}eat some really smelly cheese,</b>
<b>{\an2}and gorge on crackers and down</b>
<b>the wine. It's great.</b>
<b>{\an2}Featuring prosciutto sugar biscuits,</b>
<b>and slices of bread</b>
<b>{\an2}and cheese made from Polish</b>
<b>gingerbread,</b>
<b>{\an2}Rowan's attempting a recreation of</b>
<b>his favourite student night in.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you've got a cupboard full</b>
<b>of pinot</b>
<b>{\an2}and a load of charcuterie in</b>
<b>the fridge? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}And that's your university life?</b>
<b>{\an2}That's me, yeah. Question, how do</b>
<b>you afford all this?</b>
<b>{\an2}This is like...</b>
<b>You're at university.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm at uni. Yet you're having</b>
<b>one of these boards?</b>
<b>{\an2}You don't want to see my overdraft,</b>
<b>Alison. You don't. I don't.</b>
<b>{\an2}The battle of the grazing boards has</b>
<b>a third contender.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's like a cheese board is</b>
<b>what I'm going for.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's going to be a brie,</b>
<b>camembert, Swiss,</b>
<b>{\an2}some crackers. Yeah, I've got</b>
<b>tonnes to do.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, maybe too much. We'll see.</b>
<b>{\an2}Matty's ambitious cheese board</b>
<b>will be made up</b>
<b>{\an2}of six different biscuits,</b>
<b>including two shortbreads,</b>
<b>{\an2}macaron grapes,</b>
<b>and garibaldi crackers.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who do you think your toughest</b>
<b>{\an2}competition is?</b>
<b>Anyone you're scared of?</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi. Abbi. It's so nerve-racking</b>
<b>being behind</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi as well, cos I can see</b>
<b>everything she's doing.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is my steamer basket.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the lattice part of it.</b>
<b>{\an2}So for my Showstopper, I am making</b>
<b>a dim sum brunch</b>
<b>{\an2}because I love Chinese food.</b>
<b>{\an2}And I like cooking it a lot,</b>
<b>{\an2}it's like my favourite thing</b>
<b>to cook.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I thought, you know what,</b>
<b>I'll give it a go,</b>
<b>{\an2}make it out of biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}Abbi's dim sum feast will</b>
<b>see marzipan</b>
<b>{\an2}and cherry-filled brandy snap spring</b>
<b>rolls,</b>
<b>{\an2}alongside a lemon and Earl Grey</b>
<b>biscuit steamer</b>
<b>{\an2}and apricot and pistachio filled</b>
<b>biscuit dumplings.</b>
<b>{\an2}And I'm also making fortune cookies,</b>
<b>which aren't technically an illusion</b>
<b>{\an2}but it feels like it wouldn't be</b>
<b>complete without fortune cookies.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, I've written some</b>
<b>little fortunes.</b>
<b>{\an2}One says - Watch out, things are</b>
<b>getting "in tents".</b>
<b>{\an2}Cos we're in a tent.</b>
<b>{\an2}Also trying to impress with</b>
<b>an East Asian theme is Tasha.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm making a Japanese katsu.</b>
<b>{\an2}When my friends and I go to</b>
<b>{\an2}a new Japanese restaurant we always</b>
<b>kind of base</b>
<b>{\an2}our judgment of the restaurant on</b>
<b>how well they do the katsu.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha's biscuity take on her</b>
<b>benchmark meal will see orange</b>
<b>{\an2}and almond biscotti chicken,</b>
<b>{\an2}an intricately painted Palet Breton</b>
<b>biscuit bowl</b>
<b>{\an2}and matcha Viennese cups.</b>
<b>{\an2}You had an up and down day</b>
<b>yesterday.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think in the technical you did OK,</b>
<b>{\an2}but in the signature you smashed it</b>
<b>out the park.</b>
<b>{\an2}I expect today to be as good as</b>
<b>your signature.</b>
<b>{\an2}No pressure. No pressure. See you</b>
<b>later, Tash. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, my God.</b>
<b>{\an2}While Tasha toils to recreate</b>
<b>yesterday's success,</b>
<b>{\an2}one baker is hoping history won't be</b>
<b>repeating itself today.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm hoping to present you</b>
<b>with something that looks</b>
<b>{\an2}a bit better than the two dog's</b>
<b>breakfasts</b>
<b>{\an2}that I presented you with yesterday.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, they tasted great.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've called it my Lee on</b>
<b>Solent lunchtime meal deal.</b>
<b>{\an2}I work from home and I live near</b>
<b>the seaside,</b>
<b>{\an2}so quite often when I make my lunch,</b>
<b>I'll go down to</b>
<b>{\an2}the seaside and sit on the beach</b>
<b>for half an hour. Ah, that's lovely.</b>
<b>{\an2}And eat your meal deal. See the</b>
<b>waves coming in, eat my meal deal.</b>
<b>{\an2}And if I've been a good boy</b>
<b>{\an2}and I've worked hard in</b>
<b>the morning, I treat myself to</b>
<b>{\an2}a pink and white squirty ice cream.</b>
<b>{\an2}Keith's Viennese biscuit</b>
<b>{\an2}and raspberry buttercream ice cream</b>
<b>cone will sit beside his shortbread</b>
<b>{\an2}ham and tomato sandwich with</b>
<b>a spiced biscuit crust,</b>
<b>{\an2}and a portion of almond tuile crisps</b>
<b>contained within their cylindrical</b>
<b>{\an2}gingerbread packaging.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm creating the two halves</b>
<b>of my Pringles tube.</b>
<b>{\an2}But of course as soon as</b>
<b>the heat hits it,</b>
<b>{\an2}it all flops down to the bottom</b>
<b>of the oven,</b>
<b>{\an2}so I've got to really watch them.</b>
<b>{\an2}So that goes in.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's two things I've got to put</b>
<b>on - the timer and glasses.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I can see what's going on.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm just going to brush</b>
<b>the garibaldi with some egg white.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it gives it a glaze.</b>
<b>{\an2}That I'm then going to hide with</b>
<b>fondant. So why are we bothering?</b>
<b>{\an2}These are the burger buns. They've</b>
<b>kept their shape really nicely.</b>
<b>{\an2}While it's important</b>
<b>the bakers' biscuits showcase</b>
<b>{\an2}a variety of tastes and textures...</b>
<b>{\an2}Biscotti in.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the burger</b>
<b>{\an2}and it's a Florentine burger,</b>
<b>{\an2}so I've got walnuts, pecans</b>
<b>and almonds in there.</b>
<b>{\an2}..Paul and Prue are expecting</b>
<b>convincing illusion biscuits...</b>
<b>{\an2}These are the gingerbread cups.</b>
<b>{\an2}..so the bakers need to get creative</b>
<b>with their moulds.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the steamer basket.</b>
<b>{\an2}This basically is just</b>
<b>{\an2}to hold everything in place</b>
<b>while it bakes.</b>
<b>{\an2}And hope their choice</b>
<b>of biscuit is robust enough.</b>
<b>{\an2}Trying to make a bowl.</b>
<b>This is the Palet Breton.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's really strong. I tried</b>
<b>different doughs</b>
<b>{\an2}and they just kind of melted in</b>
<b>the oven.</b>
<b>{\an2}And Keith's gingerbread</b>
<b>crisp tubes...</b>
<b>{\an2}BLEEP.</b>
<b>{\an2}..have done just that.</b>
<b>{\an2}I can't believe the state of this.</b>
<b>{\an2}The two halves of the cylinder,</b>
<b>they've both slid off.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, a bit panicky.</b>
<b>{\an2}I made sure I made plenty of</b>
<b>gingerbread</b>
<b>{\an2}for fear of this happening.</b>
<b>{\an2}But I can't afford</b>
<b>to get it wrong twice.</b>
<b>{\an8}Bakers, you have halfway left.</b>
<b>{\an8}Halfway left?</b>
<b>{\an8}You're halfway left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Halfway there.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've got my next try at</b>
<b>the gingerbread cylinder.</b>
<b>{\an2}I would say it's slightly better.</b>
<b>I just...</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm really desperate for this</b>
<b>to happen.</b>
<b>{\an2}As Keith's crisp tube takes</b>
<b>a second shot in the oven,</b>
<b>{\an2}the other bakers' illusions are</b>
<b>starting to take shape.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now I'm just assembling the little</b>
<b>pizza and the stuffed crust.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the camembert.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is one of my two different</b>
<b>shapes of dumplings,</b>
<b>{\an2}and I'm just filling it with</b>
<b>apricot and pistachio filling.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've got my tomato rings</b>
<b>with the strawberry biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've put some crushed</b>
<b>boiled sweets,</b>
<b>{\an2}into there and they're going to</b>
<b>melt,</b>
<b>{\an2}and they'll form the watery bit</b>
<b>inside a tomato.</b>
<b>{\an2}Saku, is that real onions?</b>
<b>Yeah, that's real onion.</b>
<b>{\an2}But you're not supposed</b>
<b>to do real onions, babe.</b>
<b>{\an2}You're supposed to make it look like</b>
<b>onion. It is a side dish.</b>
<b>{\an2}But it's real onions?</b>
<b>{\an2}Really?</b>
<b>{\an2}Alongside Saku's onions will be</b>
<b>a biscuit rendering of</b>
<b>{\an2}a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,</b>
<b>featuring coconut</b>
<b>{\an2}and cardamom biscuit hoppers,</b>
<b>{\an2}rotis of cheddar, rosemary and black</b>
<b>pepper,</b>
<b>{\an1}and a chocolate and coffee</b>
<b>biscuit chicken curry.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sri Lankan breakfast is</b>
<b>very filling.</b>
<b>{\an2}So you can hold on for</b>
<b>the whole day until dinner time,</b>
<b>{\an2}maybe lunch time for me, after</b>
<b>having that breakfast.</b>
<b>{\an2}Of course Sri Lankan food is</b>
<b>the best in the world!</b>
<b>{\an2}Without a doubt.</b>
<b>{\an2}Saku might be trying to recreate</b>
<b>{\an2}a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast,</b>
<b>{\an2}but Nicky has some traditions</b>
<b>of her own.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm just sandwiching</b>
<b>the biscuits together now</b>
<b>{\an2}to sort of resemble a wee bit</b>
<b>of steak.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I'm doing a steak pie</b>
<b>{\an2}because even now when I go home,</b>
<b>{\an2}Mum always cooks a steak pie.</b>
<b>{\an2}Beneath her shortbread pie crust,</b>
<b>{\an2}Nicky's chocolate steak biscuits</b>
<b>will be sandwiched with</b>
<b>{\an2}a hazelnut and orange ganache.</b>
<b>{\an2}Rosehip marzipan peas and shortbread</b>
<b>chips will sit alongside on</b>
<b>{\an2}a plate of decorated gingerbread.</b>
<b>{\an2}I believe Dan is doing</b>
<b>a pie as well.</b>
<b>{\an2}No pressure again. Just seems</b>
<b>{\an2}to be all I ever do is get</b>
<b>under pressure, doesn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, cos Dan's pretty good.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, I don't know how I'll get on.</b>
<b>{\an2}So I am doing a cheese</b>
<b>and onion pie.</b>
<b>{\an2}When I shout from the kitchen,</b>
<b>"What pie do you</b>
<b>{\an2}"want for tea this weekend?",</b>
<b>it's always cheese</b>
<b>{\an2}and onion pie.</b>
<b>Yeah, so it's a firm favourite.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sat on gingerbread plates,</b>
<b>{\an2}Dan's shortbread pie pastry</b>
<b>will be sliced</b>
<b>{\an2}to reveal pistachio</b>
<b>shortbread onions</b>
<b>{\an2}and an orange curd cheese sauce.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nestled next to his pie will be</b>
<b>{\an2}a generous portion of shortbread</b>
<b>peas and vanilla biscuit chips.</b>
<b>{\an2}Quite a mess, your work station.</b>
<b>It's giving me a panic attack.</b>
<b>{\an2}I know. I'm in the process of</b>
<b>clearing my decks at the moment.</b>
<b>{\an2}You know who loves that? Paul</b>
<b>Hollywood.</b>
<b>{\an2}Like, this would freak him out.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, I know. He'd just be like,</b>
<b>"Argh!" That's why he</b>
<b>{\an2}was just like tutting and shaking</b>
<b>his head walking past me before.</b>
<b>{\an2}Have you ever seen one</b>
<b>of his work stations?</b>
<b>{\an2}No. Denim.</b>
<b>{\an2}Starched denim.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one hour left.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's so exciting, just one hour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ooh. Cannot begin to tell you how</b>
<b>relieved I am with that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah!</b>
<b>{\an2}With his crisp tube trauma in</b>
<b>the past, Keith is free</b>
<b>{\an2}to finish his final batches...</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm making these things called tuile</b>
<b>biscuits</b>
<b>{\an2}to represent crisps.</b>
<b>{\an2}..and the rest of the bakers can</b>
<b>start bringing their illusions</b>
<b>{\an2}to life with decoration.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, yeah, I love this bit.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm just painting up</b>
<b>the gingerbread plate.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's quite hard cos the icing's</b>
<b>not set.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is what makes it look</b>
<b>like bamboo.</b>
<b>{\an2}Doing some lattice work here</b>
<b>to achieve the red</b>
<b>{\an2}and white chequered parchment you</b>
<b>usually get your burger served on.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cut this, cut this.</b>
<b>{\an2}Chuffing heck. I'm looking around</b>
<b>{\an2}and everybody's is so good</b>
<b>and realistic.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is shocking.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have 30 minutes left.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm putting melted chocolate onto</b>
<b>these florentines just</b>
<b>{\an2}to make them look like the burgers.</b>
<b>{\an2}Is there anything I can do</b>
<b>to help you? No.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you want to get on my shoulders?</b>
<b>{\an2}No. OK, maybe later.</b>
<b>{\an2}But thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is royal icing which is</b>
<b>the tomato sauce.</b>
<b>{\an2}My favourite bit actually is</b>
<b>the tomato rings.</b>
<b>{\an2}They look really, really pretty.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is meant to represent the seeds</b>
<b>of the tomato.</b>
<b>{\an2}The top of the camembert,</b>
<b>I've just torched it.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is white chocolate</b>
<b>{\an2}and this is creating</b>
<b>the cheese pull for the pizza.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just got to make the brie look like</b>
<b>the brie.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, we're getting there now,</b>
<b>aren't we?</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have five minutes left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Scissors, scissors, scissors!</b>
<b>{\an2}Get some chips on,</b>
<b>let's see how they look.</b>
<b>{\an2}I do like my chips on</b>
<b>the darker side.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just piping the grapes</b>
<b>and the olives.</b>
<b>{\an2}How long do we have?</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, you have one minute left.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tuile pepperoni.</b>
<b>{\an2}Taking it to the wire.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're little gherkins.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, that is time up.</b>
<b>{\an2}Please step away from</b>
<b>your Showstoppers.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's so bad.</b>
<b>{\an2}First time in three things I haven't</b>
<b>had an absolutely mad panic.</b>
<b>{\an2}Have I forgotten anything?</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh's is BLEEP outrageous.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, that's sick, innit?</b>
<b>{\an2}It's judgment time for the bakers'</b>
<b>biscuit illusion banquets.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha, would you like to bring up</b>
<b>your Showstopper, please?</b>
<b>{\an8}I think it looks good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's very pretty.</b>
<b>{\an2}It does give the illusion of being</b>
<b>a chicken katsu.</b>
<b>{\an2}Um, I'll take a little bit of the...</b>
<b>{\an2}It is a Palet Breton lemon-flavoured</b>
<b>bowl.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hmm. Mm. Good, isn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}That biscuit is nice</b>
<b>and sharp with flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Limoncello comes through nicely.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's have some of the chicken.</b>
<b>{\an2}This one is an orange and almond</b>
<b>biscotti coated in white chocolate.</b>
<b>{\an2}That biscotti's delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh.</b>
<b>{\an2}I love the crunch, the flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}The texture's spot on.</b>
<b>Really good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Both of those biscuits are perfect.</b>
<b>{\an2}You have set a bar that's</b>
<b>a little bit high.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you so much.</b>
<b>{\an8}Well, I think that it looks</b>
<b>wonderful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look at this.</b>
<b>That's the ginger.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ginger's got a good flavour,</b>
<b>nice and warm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Is this a biscotti? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Almond and dried cherry.</b>
<b>{\an2}Biscotti's very nice,</b>
<b>it's nice and tangy.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think you've done well.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's smart, it's neat. Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you, guys.</b>
<b>{\an2}We'll start...</b>
<b>We'll have a look at these.</b>
<b>{\an2}These are...</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a spiced black pepper</b>
<b>gingerbread type thing.</b>
<b>{\an2}Good flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Texture's softened slightly,</b>
<b>{\an2}uh, because of the topping on it.</b>
<b>{\an2}The illusion bit doesn't work</b>
<b>all that well.</b>
<b>{\an2}After a while, you realise that's</b>
<b>maybe salami on top.</b>
<b>{\an2}Is that right? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}But I do like the flavours,</b>
<b>your flavours are good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a terrific illusion. I mean,</b>
<b>as soon as you look at it,</b>
<b>{\an2}it really looks like a cheeseboard.</b>
<b>{\an2}These sort of crackers,</b>
<b>this is the one I want to try.</b>
<b>{\an2}I saw you making these.</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, they looked as if they were</b>
<b>stuffed with cranberries.</b>
<b>{\an2}Very crumbly shortbread.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's lovely. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done, Matty. Thank you, Matty.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you, cheers.</b>
<b>{\an8}I think it's clever.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm not quite sure I've seen</b>
<b>many tomatoes...</b>
<b>{\an2}..like that. No.</b>
<b>{\an2}They're from the south coast. We...</b>
<b>{\an2}We have very good...</b>
<b>{\an2}We have very good growing</b>
<b>conditions,</b>
<b>{\an2}and you get that redness.</b>
<b>That's amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}I do like the way you've done</b>
<b>the bread. Oh, dear.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's very soft.</b>
<b>{\an2}Great flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}Your flavours are always good.</b>
<b>{\an2}The issue is, I shouldn't be able to</b>
<b>push my finger in like that. No.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's too soft.</b>
<b>{\an2}The ham slice in the middle,</b>
<b>is that the same?</b>
<b>{\an2}Yes.</b>
<b>{\an2}That is much better baked.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, the ice cream.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's vanilla-flavoured Viennese</b>
<b>and raspberry buttercream.</b>
<b>{\an2}Slightly raw inside the biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}You struggled on this one a bit,</b>
<b>Keith.</b>
<b>{\an2}I have to say, I've never seen</b>
<b>a pizza that deep.</b>
<b>{\an2}Neither have I, to be honest!</b>
<b>{\an2}But that's the dream.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, the bottom two are the</b>
<b>shortbread,</b>
<b>{\an2}and the top is just a vanilla</b>
<b>biscuit with the date filling.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, I enjoyed all that a lot.</b>
<b>{\an2}You've done a really good job</b>
<b>with that.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think the flavours and textures</b>
<b>are clever.</b>
<b>{\an2}And it's so original.</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, I love the date-stuffed</b>
<b>crust.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you, Dana. Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}I like the look of this,</b>
<b>this is clever.</b>
<b>{\an2}Love the steam basket. Very nice,</b>
<b>steamer basket, it's beautiful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Absolutely perfect.</b>
<b>{\an2}And what's in these?</b>
<b>{\an2}So, it's an apricot, pistachio</b>
<b>and thyme filling.</b>
<b>{\an2}Filling is very strong,</b>
<b>but it's delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}And the biscuit is crisp</b>
<b>and flavoursome.</b>
<b>{\an2}It looks like a dim sum.</b>
<b>This looks lovely.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, I think you've done a decent job</b>
<b>with this.</b>
<b>{\an2}The illusion works.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much.</b>
<b>Thank you. Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}These are the rotis?</b>
<b>Very delicious.</b>
<b>{\an2}That is fantastic.</b>
<b>They're so good.</b>
<b>{\an2}That in its own right should be</b>
<b>a well-known Sri Lankan delicacy.</b>
<b>{\an2}OK. Let's try a hopper.</b>
<b>{\an2}The spices in there are good,</b>
<b>{\an2}but I think you could've done</b>
<b>more with that.</b>
<b>{\an2}Perhaps if you'd have made the egg</b>
<b>a little bigger</b>
<b>{\an2}and done it with spring onion,</b>
<b>a bit of chilli,</b>
<b>{\an2}so that it looked more colourful.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>{\an8}It's just beautiful. Amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}Are these chips shortbread?</b>
<b>{\an2}Uh, just vanilla,</b>
<b>like a sable biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}They taste nice,</b>
<b>but they are a little bit burnt.</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's have a look at this pie.</b>
<b>{\an2}What is the biscuit here?</b>
<b>This is...</b>
<b>{\an2}It's, like, a pistachio shortbread</b>
<b>in there, as well.</b>
<b>{\an2}Do you know, I think it's</b>
<b>absolutely delicious. It is.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it's a triumph,</b>
<b>I really do.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think you've done a great job</b>
<b>on the biscuits,</b>
<b>{\an2}except for the overbaking slightly.</b>
<b>{\an2}And the filling is wonderful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done. Excellent.</b>
<b>Well done, Dan.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much. Thanks.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a good looking thing.</b>
<b>I mean, it's...</b>
<b>{\an2}It's neat. It's quite well detailed,</b>
<b>and it is neat.</b>
<b>{\an2}Right, let's try the shortbread.</b>
<b>{\an2}To be honest, your chips do look</b>
<b>more like shortbread fingers</b>
<b>{\an2}than chips.</b>
<b>LAUGHING: They do, don't they?</b>
<b>{\an2}They do, don't they?</b>
<b>{\an2}What is the beef?</b>
<b>{\an2}The beef is a chocolate biscuit</b>
<b>with chocolate ganache,</b>
<b>{\an2}with orange and hazelnuts</b>
<b>through it.</b>
<b>{\an2}The chocolate and hazelnut</b>
<b>are beautiful.</b>
<b>{\an2}The texture falls apart</b>
<b>in the mouth.</b>
<b>{\an2}And the ganache just tops it off.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's a good sandwich biscuit.</b>
<b>Mm.</b>
<b>{\an2}And what's the bowl made of?</b>
<b>{\an2}Gingerbread.</b>
<b>{\an2}Gingerbread. Gingerbread.</b>
<b>{\an2}The flavour of the ginger's very</b>
<b>gingery. It's too thick and</b>
<b>underbaked.</b>
<b>{\an2}Just needed longer in the oven...</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}..and thinner, and it would've</b>
<b>been better. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh, it is so neat,</b>
<b>{\an2}and so clearly what it is.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it's a little triumph.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think it's a big triumph.</b>
<b>{\an2}This is the orange shortbread,</b>
<b>isn't it? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's beautiful. Beautiful.</b>
<b>{\an2}Delicate. Light.</b>
<b>{\an2}Hmm.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, look at that.</b>
<b>Look at that tomato.</b>
<b>{\an2}Look at that tomato. Let me hold</b>
<b>it up. That's clever.</b>
<b>{\an2}You can see through it.</b>
<b>{\an2}Isn't that amazing?</b>
<b>{\an2}Let's try this chocolate one.</b>
<b>{\an2}There's walnuts, pecans</b>
<b>and almonds in there,</b>
<b>{\an2}and then some currants</b>
<b>and some cherries, as well.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's chewy, it's crispy, it's zingy,</b>
<b>{\an2}it's full of flavour.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think overall you've created...</b>
<b>something a little bit special.</b>
<b>{\an2}You don't often get illusion stuff</b>
<b>that tastes</b>
<b>{\an2}and looks as good as that.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>{\an2}That's amazing, mate. Yeah, well</b>
<b>done. Cheers, thank you. Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}That was incredible, wasn't it?</b>
<b>{\an2}Wasn't expecting that at all.</b>
<b>{\an2}Know what, mate?</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh, come on.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'll come to you.</b>
<b>Oh, thank you. Oh, wow.</b>
<b>{\an2}That was amazing.</b>
<b>Honestly, it was seriously good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Amazing.</b>
<b>{\an2}I think Josh has pipped Star Baker.</b>
<b>{\an2}But that's fine.</b>
<b>{\an2}Another time.</b>
<b>{\an2}I was...</b>
<b>{\an2}..touching distance,</b>
<b>and then it was gone.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm actually quite good at</b>
<b>making a real steak pie,</b>
<b>{\an2}but maybe not so much out</b>
<b>of biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, I've got a right to be</b>
<b>a bit concerned, I think.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's decision time for</b>
<b>Paul and Prue.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who will be crowned Star Baker</b>
<b>{\an2}and who will be leaving the tent?</b>
<b>{\an2}What a Showstopper.</b>
<b>You got your handshake out.</b>
<b>{\an2}Ah. Yeah, it was delayed.</b>
<b>{\an2}It was, because I was so full</b>
<b>of biscuit.</b>
<b>{\an2}It... Everything was numb.</b>
<b>{\an2}And then, eventually,</b>
<b>it hit me, and I went,</b>
<b>{\an2}"Hang on a minute, I owe him</b>
<b>a handshake." That was so good.</b>
<b>{\an2}Josh is definitely in the running</b>
<b>for Star Baker. Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, he was sort midway,</b>
<b>but he's just escalated himself</b>
<b>{\an2}into the position of challenging</b>
<b>for Star Baker.</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm really thrilled about Tash,</b>
<b>cos I think she's up there, too.</b>
<b>{\an2}I agree. I mean, she's hardly</b>
<b>put a foot wrong.</b>
<b>{\an2}Who do you think's in danger</b>
<b>of going?</b>
<b>{\an2}Keith. Yeah, Keith.</b>
<b>{\an2}The thing is with Keith, he's got</b>
<b>flavour, he's delivering good taste.</b>
<b>{\an2}Nicky has struggled a bit, as well.</b>
<b>{\an2}I mean, when you look at her bakes</b>
<b>and look at everybody else's,</b>
<b>{\an2}you think, "Oh, hang on a minute.</b>
<b>{\an2}"It's not as good as we initially</b>
<b>thought it was."</b>
<b>{\an2}Well, I'm glad I'm not in your</b>
<b>shoes, judges.</b>
<b>{\an2}We'd quite like to have eaten</b>
<b>70 biscuits.</b>
<b>{\an2}Bakers, well done,</b>
<b>it's been an amazing week</b>
<b>{\an2}and it was a fabulous show stopper.</b>
<b>{\an2}Fortunately, I've got the great job</b>
<b>of announcing which one of you</b>
<b>{\an2}will be Star Baker this week.</b>
<b>{\an2}And the person who is Star Baker</b>
<b>this week is...</b>
<b>{\an2}..Tasha.</b>
<b>{\an2}Now, sadly, I have the job</b>
<b>of letting go of one baker.</b>
<b>{\an2}And with just getting to</b>
<b>knowing you all,</b>
<b>{\an2}we're absolutely adoring you.</b>
<b>{\an2}But the baker leaving today is...</b>
<b>{\an2}..Keith.</b>
<b>{\an2}Sorry, Keith. That's all right.</b>
<b>{\an2}I feel fine. There's nothing sad</b>
<b>about this moment.</b>
<b>{\an2}Thank you very much. It's been so</b>
<b>lovely to meet you, Prue.</b>
<b>{\an2}I've had the most fantastic time.</b>
<b>{\an2}I said to somebody, the first</b>
<b>weekend there was bruises</b>
<b>{\an2}up and down my arms where I was</b>
<b>pinching myself every half hour.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, I don't know how many hours</b>
<b>I'm going to spend in the rest</b>
<b>{\an2}of my life banging on about this.</b>
<b>{\an2}Very happy to still be here.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, yes, happy.</b>
<b>{\an2}But sad at the same time,</b>
<b>because Keith's gone.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}Tasha's such a deserving Star Baker</b>
<b>this week, because her signature</b>
<b>{\an2}yesterday - and I tasted her</b>
<b>signature - it was incredible.</b>
<b>{\an2}So, it was well worth Star Baker</b>
<b>for the week on its own.</b>
<b>{\an2}The handshake, I'll remember that</b>
<b>for a long time.</b>
<b>{\an2}Well done.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's the weirdest feeling,</b>
<b>{\an2}because you put all this time</b>
<b>and this energy and...</b>
<b>{\an2}At the end of the day,</b>
<b>it's biscuit, or it's cake,</b>
<b>{\an2}or it's something that you eat.</b>
<b>{\an2}But...</b>
<b>{\an2}..it means so much.</b>
<b>{\an2}And, yeah...</b>
<b>{\an2}Yeah, it's... it's a really</b>
<b>good feeling.</b>
<b>{\an2}Next time - it's bread week...</b>
<b>{\an2}I'm really nervous.</b>
<b>You're nervous about this one?</b>
<b>{\an2}I just don't want him to not</b>
<b>like it.</b>
<b>{\an2}It's all about Paul? Yeah.</b>
<b>{\an2}..as the bakers take on a classic</b>
<b>cottage loaf signature.</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh! It's enormous.</b>
<b>Oh, my God.</b>
<b>{\an2}A traditional technical...</b>
<b>{\an2}..that leaves some hot under</b>
<b>the collar.</b>
<b>{\an2}Cool those balls!</b>
<b>{\an2}And a plaited show stopper...</b>
<b>{\an2}Help me, Lord.</b>
<b>{\an2}..that has them tied up in knots.</b>
<b>{\an2}Stressful.</b>
<b>{\an1}GLASS BREAKS</b>
<b>{\an2}Oh!</b>
<b>{\an2}Chuffing heck.</b>
<b>You just want an easy life.</b>
